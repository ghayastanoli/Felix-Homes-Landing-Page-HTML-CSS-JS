I mean really... It's Nashville! One of many cities where an agent who doesn't waste a clients time can make thousands for just a few hours of work. A six percent commission has become a really unfair deal for a seller of a $300k + home that sells before any real marketing budget gets spent. Tyler was the answer. His commission at 1% is what it should be per company involved in any one transaction. He always answered the phone when I called and had an answer for everything I asked. Our house was sold in two weeks and I will say that the only thing that annoyed me about the entire deal was the buyer's agent getting 2.5%. Far too much for less than 10 hours of work. I sent two of my costumers to him who mentioned they wanted to sell. Both happened while mine was waiting to close and both went under contract quickly. Felix is the only way a Nashvillian should sell their home. High commissions no longer make wise business sense.</p></div><p class="Testimonial_see-more__oGOpi cz-color-15890261">See More</p></div><div class="Testimonial_about-author__ZvXm6 cz-color-5846819"><div class="cz-color-5846819">Aldo &amp; Beth C.<!-- -->, <!-- -->Antioch, TN</div><div class="Testimonial_footer__D2Mj4 cz-color-5846819">15 Days On Market<!-- --> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="swiper-slide swiper-slide-duplicate cz-color-0 swiper-slide-prev" data-swiper-slide-index="2" style="margin-right: 36px;"><div class="Testimonials_slide-wrapper__FVHDm cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_container__zqRGe cz-color-0 cz-color-16777215"><div class="Testimonial_image-wrapper__n6caE cz-color-0"><img src="https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_2175130_0_1_3d1c5e4b0a.jpg" alt="House of reviewer" class="cz-color-0"></div><div class="Testimonial_content__R6_eC cz-color-0"><div class="cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_rating-wrapper__FfgqU cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_rating__TN7Pp cz-color-0"><img src="/images/Google.svg" alt="review-platform" class="Testimonial_reviews-img__oWLSg cz-color-0"><span class="MuiRating-root Testimonial_rating-stars__4qC0l MuiRating-readOnly cz-color-5885439" role="img" aria-label="5 Stars"><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span></span></div><div class="Testimonial_saved-wrapper__sI2hr cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_saved__z42Ur cz-color-6540142 cz-color-14743010"><span class="cz-color-6540142">Saved $<!-- -->8,513</span></div></div></div><div class="Testimonial_text__kwec9 cz-color-8019791"><p class="cz-color-8019791">As a buyer, I have never had a smoother experience navigating the complex details of purchasing a home.

I mean really... It's Nashville! One of many cities where an agent who doesn't waste a clients time can make thousands for just a few hours of work. A six percent commission has become a really unfair deal for a seller of a $300k + home that sells before any real marketing budget gets spent. Tyler was the answer. His commission at 1% is what it should be per company involved in any one transaction. He always answered the phone when I called and had an answer for everything I asked. Our house was sold in two weeks and I will say that the only thing that annoyed me about the entire deal was the buyer's agent getting 2.5%. Far too much for less than 10 hours of work. I sent two of my costumers to him who mentioned they wanted to sell. Both happened while mine was waiting to close and both went under contract quickly. Felix is the only way a Nashvillian should sell their home. High commissions no longer make wise business sense.</p></div><p class="Testimonial_see-more__oGOpi cz-color-15890261">See More</p></div><div class="Testimonial_about-author__ZvXm6 cz-color-5846819"><div class="cz-color-5846819">Aldo &amp; Beth C.<!-- -->, <!-- -->Antioch, TN</div><div class="Testimonial_footer__D2Mj4 cz-color-5846819">15 Days On Market<!-- --> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="swiper-slide cz-color-0 swiper-slide-duplicate-prev" data-swiper-slide-index="2" style="margin-right: 36px;"><div class="Testimonials_slide-wrapper__FVHDm cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_container__zqRGe cz-color-0 cz-color-16777215"><div class="Testimonial_image-wrapper__n6caE cz-color-0"><img src="https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_2175130_0_1_3d1c5e4b0a.jpg" alt="House of reviewer" class="cz-color-0"></div><div class="Testimonial_content__R6_eC cz-color-0"><div class="cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_rating-wrapper__FfgqU cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_rating__TN7Pp cz-color-0"><img src="/images/Google.svg" alt="review-platform" class="Testimonial_reviews-img__oWLSg cz-color-0"><span class="MuiRating-root Testimonial_rating-stars__4qC0l MuiRating-readOnly cz-color-5885439" role="img" aria-label="5 Stars"><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span></span></div><div class="Testimonial_saved-wrapper__sI2hr cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_saved__z42Ur cz-color-6540142 cz-color-14743010"><span class="cz-color-6540142">Saved $<!-- -->8,513</span></div></div></div><div class="Testimonial_text__kwec9 cz-color-8019791"><p class="cz-color-8019791">As a buyer, I have never had a smoother experience navigating the complex details of purchasing a home.

I mean really... It's Nashville! One of many cities where an agent who doesn't waste a clients time can make thousands for just a few hours of work. A six percent commission has become a really unfair deal for a seller of a $300k + home that sells before any real marketing budget gets spent. Tyler was the answer. His commission at 1% is what it should be per company involved in any one transaction. He always answered the phone when I called and had an answer for everything I asked. Our house was sold in two weeks and I will say that the only thing that annoyed me about the entire deal was the buyer's agent getting 2.5%. Far too much for less than 10 hours of work. I sent two of my costumers to him who mentioned they wanted to sell. Both happened while mine was waiting to close and both went under contract quickly. Felix is the only way a Nashvillian should sell their home. High commissions no longer make wise business sense.</p></div><p class="Testimonial_see-more__oGOpi cz-color-15890261">See More</p></div><div class="Testimonial_about-author__ZvXm6 cz-color-5846819"><div class="cz-color-5846819">Aldo &amp; Beth C.<!-- -->, <!-- -->Antioch, TN</div><div class="Testimonial_footer__D2Mj4 cz-color-5846819">15 Days On Market<!-- --> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="swiper-slide swiper-slide-duplicate cz-color-0" data-swiper-slide-index="2" style="margin-right: 36px;"><div class="Testimonials_slide-wrapper__FVHDm cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_container__zqRGe cz-color-0 cz-color-16777215"><div class="Testimonial_image-wrapper__n6caE cz-color-0"><img src="https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_2175130_0_1_3d1c5e4b0a.jpg" alt="House of reviewer" class="cz-color-0"></div><div class="Testimonial_content__R6_eC cz-color-0"><div class="cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_rating-wrapper__FfgqU cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_rating__TN7Pp cz-color-0"><img src="/images/Google.svg" alt="review-platform" class="Testimonial_reviews-img__oWLSg cz-color-0"><span class="MuiRating-root Testimonial_rating-stars__4qC0l MuiRating-readOnly cz-color-5885439" role="img" aria-label="5 Stars"><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span><span class="cz-color-5885439"><span class="MuiRating-icon MuiRating-iconFilled cz-color-5885439"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeInherit cz-color-5885439" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 17.27L18.18 21l-1.64-7.03L22 9.24l-7.19-.61L12 2 9.19 8.63 2 9.24l5.46 4.73L5.82 21z" class="cz-color-5885439"></path></svg></span></span></span></div><div class="Testimonial_saved-wrapper__sI2hr cz-color-0"><div class="Testimonial_saved__z42Ur cz-color-6540142 cz-color-14743010"><span class="cz-color-6540142">Saved $<!-- -->8,513</span></div></div></div><div class="Testimonial_text__kwec9 cz-color-8019791"><p class="cz-color-8019791">As a buyer, I have never had a smoother experience navigating the complex details of purchasing a home.

In addition to no state income tax, the overall property tax rates are on the lower end. On average, the effective tax rate on your property is 0.74%. Although [Davidson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county), which the city of Nashville is located in just increased property taxes by 34%, they are still competitive with growing metropolitan cities like Charlotte and Atlanta. This low rate is difficult to pass up compared to other areas in the nation.\n\n### The mild climate\n\nThe northeast can see bitter cold winters and the south can be excessively hot in the summer. [Tennessee is a nice blend of both extremes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). Our climate is mild. We get the beautiful 4 seasons, but our winters are not nearly as cold as our friends up north, and our summers are not as humid as the more southern states. Seeing as most retirees prefer warmer climates, this makes Tennessee a great option to consider!\n\n### Tennessee has a beautiful landscape\n\nThe beauty in Tennessee is hard to describe. There is arguably nothing prettier than having the great smoky mountains as a backdrop or [living along the hundreds of lakeshore miles](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-a-waterfront-property-in-tennessee) throughout the state. Tennessee is also known for its rolling hills and open farmland.\n\n### Our culture and history\n\nCountry music, southern hospitality, and a slower pace of life are certainly popular attributes that catch the hearts of most retirees. Our cities still have that small-town feel, but provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. The list goes on and on. There are so many reasons why people consider retiring in Tennessee. The only difficult decision is [finding the right town or city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) to call home!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Best Place To Retire In Tennessee?\n\nThis is one of the questions we get asked a lot at Felix Homes. There are plenty of great cities to live in, or near, picking between popular cities like Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville is nearly impossible. Instead of choosing just one, we collected our list of the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\nBefore we get into the list, if you're searching for the best [retirement communities in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-retirement-communities-tennessee), we wrote another article specifically focusing on that.

The median home value is $230,000 per year.\n\n### #9 - Memphis\nDespite having a population of over 650,000 people, Memphis still very much feels like a small country town. Situated on the great Mississippi River, Memphis has a unique character that cannot be duplicated in any other city on our list. There are plenty of activities to do inside of the city, or if you're looking for a more laid back lifestyle in your retirement years, the suburbs of Memphis and neighboring communities make for a great place to call home. The median home value is on the low end, so you'll really be able to stretch your retirement dollar here!\n\n### #8 - Murfreesboro\nWell known for its American Civil War History, Murfreesboro makes our list at spot number eight. The affordable median home price of $250,000, and affordable tax rates, make this area a great place for retirees to live. Retired residents can enjoy playing golf at the Old Fort Golf Club, or relax at one of the beautiful outdoor parks. The large Middle Tennessee State University campus keeps the city young at heart, and you'll enjoy plenty of entertainment, shows, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Murfreesboro.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Knoxville\nSituated just an hour north of the great smoky mountains national park, and home to the legendary University of Tennessee college football team, Knoxville surely makes our list of best places to retire in Tennessee.

This is far enough outside of Nashville if you're seeking a laid back lifestyle, but just a short drive into the city where you can enjoy tons of shows, plays, concerts, restaurants, and museums.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like living in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-oak-hill-in-nashville)**\n\n### #4 - Pigeon Forge / Gatlinburg\nJust 40 minutes west of the North Carolina border sits Pigeon Forge.

No matter the season, the smoky mountains of Tennessee will always be a magnificent sight to see. Pigeon Forge is a small town that is well known for its amazing retirement benefits. The low cost of living, pretty views, and ease of access in and out of larger cities, makes this one of the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n### #3 - Franklin\nWhy is Franklin one of the best places to retire in Tennessee? Franklin is not only a historically rich town, it's also an affluent town. The active downtown surely promises a great culture. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, museums, and a fantastic music culture, Franklin is nothing shy of an amazing place to be. Your life can be as active as you'd like. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from. From walking trails, various parks, and several public golf courses, it's no secret why the population is on the rise!\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our Franklin neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Kingston Springs\nKingston Springs is a beautiful town located in Cheatham County just 20 miles southwest of the big city (Downtown Nashville). The population is shy of 6,000 residents. Residents of Kingston Springs love the several outdoor adventures this rural town provides. Between hiking, fishing in the river, golf, or canoeing, you won't be bored here. Kingston Springs is an incredibly safe place to be with a very low crime rate. Better yet, if the outdoor activities do not keep you busy, you can drive 25 minutes to Downtown Nashville and enjoy all this large metropolitan city has to offer. Most homes in Cheatham County are on over an acre of land so Kingston Springs is our pick for retirees who prefer some privacy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)**\n\n### #1 - Tellico Lake\nThe Tellico Lake community tops our list as the best place to retire and for good reason.

Roughly an hour drive to the smoky mountains and half an hour away from Knoxville, Tellico Lake provides the best of both worlds.\n\n## Areas To Avoid\nNow that we covered the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee, what are some places you should avoid?\n\n### Davidson County\nWhile the city of Nashville is located in Davidson County, if you're looking to avoid rising property taxes in your retirement years, we would suggest looking for homes outside of county limits. If you're able to put up with [higher property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike), Davidson County has a lot to offer.\n\n### Dyersburg\nDyersburg is one of the cities we'd recommend you avoid. With a population of roughly 17,000, it's surprising how high the crime rate is compared to the national average. The city has struggled to expand and develop over the years. It's located on the west end of Tennessee, and hours away from vibrant, culturally rich, cities.\n\n### Jackson\n70 miles east of Memphis is Jackson Tennessee. Unfortunately, Jackson makes the top 100 most dangerous cities in America list. Much of the city has a household income below the poverty line.\n\n## Looking To Retire In Tennessee?\nIf you're looking to retire in Tennessee, we're here to help.

Location. Location.\n\nBut what exactly does location mean, and why is it so important? Location isn't just about the street the property is located on, although that plays a major role. The location also includes; the town, the proximity the home is to various amenities, and how safe the neighborhood is. Why is this so important? You can change the color of your house, update the kitchen, and add an extra bathroom. But you can't change the location of the home. Safety is a key piece to this puzzle, and we've compiled a list of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked?\n\nBefore we dive into the list of safest places to live in Tennessee, let's first define what safety means, and how a city or town tracks its safety level. There are two main crime statistics that are tracked; violent crimes and property crimes. A key thing to note is that crime rates are benchmarked per 1,000 residents. For example, if 'the violent crime rate in a city is 2 per 1,000.' That simply means, on average, 2 in every 1,000 people are victims of a violent crime. \n\n### Violent Crimes\n\nAccording to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime), violent crimes are \"composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as those offenses which involve a threat of force.\" A town with a low violent crime rate will have fewer reported violent crimes per year. \n\n### Property Crimes\n\nThe [FBI defines](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/property-crime) property crimes as the following offenses; \"burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.\" A town with a low property crime rate will have fewer instances of these crimes being reported per year. \n\nIf you're looking for the [best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee) or the [best places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee), you should be looking for a town with low property crime and violent crime rates! \n\n[**PRO TIP: Is The Volunteer State calling your name?

Not only is the violent crime rate low, but the property crime rate is also well below the national median. Coming in at 8.74 per 1,000 residents, it's clear this gorgeous town surely ranks as one of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\nThe town's own police department does a great job and law enforcement is present in the public schools, patrolling the downtown area, and will even attend sporting events. This suburb deserves its reputation as one of Tennessee's safest cities.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Brentwood neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-brentwood-tennessee)**\n\n### Franklin\n\nAnother Williamson County town hits the list.

Although this is higher than violent crimes, it is still below the national average making it one of the safest cities in Tennessee.\n\n### Nolensville\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Nolensville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Nolensville_0f58090021.jpg)\n\nIf you're traveling on route 41A, you'll come across Nolensville Tennessee south of Nashville.

Oak Ridge, Clarksville,  Collegedale, and Collierville are all considered desirable places to live within Tennessee and provide a sense of comfort and security.\n\n## Is Tennessee A Safe State?\n\nMany people are proud to call Tennessee home. This is for good reason. The state has a favorable tax system, a mild climate, and is in a convenient location. Not only that, for the most part, this state is a safe place to live! Of course, there are some parts of the state that inflate the overall crime rate, and we'll touch on that below. \n\nThe safest area of Tennessee is located in the suburbs just outside of Nashville. Many of the suburbs listed above are all within 40 minutes of Nashville. Our pick for the safest city in Tennessee is Brentwood!\n\n## What States Are Considered The Safest In The U.S.?\n\nThe North East is well known for being the safest part of the country. Maine is the safest state, but Vermont is a close second. New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut are all in the top 10 safest states in America. \n\n## How Does Nashville Compare To Similar Cities?\n\nHow does Nashville stack up against other well-known cities? Overall, Nashville ranks safer than Atlanta from both a property and violent crime rate. However, Austin, Denver, and Charlotte all have a slight safety advantage. \n\n## What Are The Top 10 Safest Cities In The U.S.?\n\nAccording to [safe wise](https://www.safewise.com/safest-cities-america/), the top 10 safest cities in America are:\n\n1. Broadview Heights, Ohio\n2. Hopkinton, Massachusetts\n3. Oakland Township, Michigan\n4. Ridgefield, Connecticut\n5. Bergenfield, New Jersey\n6. New Castle Town, New York\n7. Franklin, Massachusetts\n8. Bedford Town, New York\n9. Shrewsbury, Massachusetts\n10. Bernards Township, New Jersey\n \n\n## What Cities In Tennessee Are The Least Safe?\n\nNow that we covered what are the safest areas in Tennessee, let's review the more dangerous areas. \n\n### Johnson City\n\nJohnson City has a crime rate of 41 per 1000, making it one of the highest crime rates in America compared to other communities of the same size. Property crime is also common, impacting nearly one person per every 24! \n\n### Memphis\n\nA 2020 study suggested Memphis Tennessee was ranked the most dangerous city in the country! The crime rate is 81 per 1,000 residents. \n\n### Dyersburg\n\nDyersburg has one of the highest crime rates in Tennessee and compared to cities of the same size across the country, its safety rating isn't looking good. The crime rate is 67 per 1,000 - well above the national median.\n\n### Nashville Metro\n\nThe crime rate for the Nashville Metro is 54 per 1,000. Unfortunately, despite the wonderful music and food culture this city has to offer, crime does not stay away. That said, not all neighborhoods in the Nashville metro have a high crime rate. Neighborhoods such as Green Hills, Sylvan Park, or Oak Hill are safe. The overall Nashville crime rate gets dragged down by up-and-coming neighborhoods such as [North Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-north-nashville), [Antioch](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-antioch-in-nashville), or parts of [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-east-nashville).\n\n### Jackson\n\nLocated on the western side of the state is Jackson Tennessee.

This is a genuine concern for many people. Tennessee cities tend to be more progressive than surrounding areas. So narrow down your home search to Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville when moving to Tennessee.\n\n## Most Expensive Places To Live In Tennessee\n\nMaybe you want to live in luxury when you make a move to Tennessee, well we have you covered. Tennessee is home to some seriously affluent communities. You will have access to the communities, prestige, services, schools, and amenities of living among the wealthy. Here are a few of the most affluent communities for you to consider before making your move.\n\n[**PRO TIP: See our complete guide of the wealthiest cities in Tennessee.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/richest-cities-in-tennessee)\n\n### Forest Hills\n\nWith a median household income of $299,069 and a median property value of $853,000, Forest Hills is a pricey place to lay down roots. Forest Hills is a town inside of Davidson County but opted out from becoming a part of the consolidated metropolitan government in Nashville. So you get your own exclusive enclave, but you still get to call Nashville home. Forest Hills has many treed lots with large homes. There are no businesses here, so you will have to head over to Nashville or Brentwood for services, stores, and restaurants. But if a big house and a big yard is your thing in Nashville, then this may be your place.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Forest Hills.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/forest-hills)\n\n### Belle Meade\n\nBelle Meade is what you think of when you hear “old money.” You will find that driving along Belle Meade Boulevard with the large historic homes and exclusive country clubs. Like Forest Hills, Belle Meade is a separate town that exists inside of Davidson County in Nashville. Residents here make on average $220,417 per household each year, and the average property value comes in at $860,000. This is also the place to live if you want to live close to Percy Warner Park (Nashville’s best park) and have access to all of the amenities of west Nashville.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Belle Meade.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/belle-meade)\n\n### Oak Hill\n\nWhile Brentwood deserves to be on this top three, we’ve included Oak Hill because Brentwood has been mentioned above. Oak Hill is just a few miles north of Brentwood. Like Belle Meade and Forest Hills, it is a community that decided not to consolidate into Metro Nashville’s government. So it is another enclave of wealth inside of Nashville. Oak Hill has one of Nashville’s most popular treasures: Radnor Lake. This is a lake with hiking trails that exists inside Nashville. (It’s impossible to even get a parking spot on a beautiful day because it’s so popular.) Oak Hill boasts large houses on large lots and is home to many celebrities and country singers. A house in Oak Hill will average in value at $719,000. So you will pay to live in this exclusive community.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Oak Hill.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/oak-hill)\n\n## Most Affordable Places To Live In Tennessee\n\nYour move to Tennessee should simplify your life. Part of that should involve getting more for your money when you’re home shopping. You can find many affordable options in rural areas in Tennessee. So if you have ever dreamed of having that perfect piece of land or farm, now’s the time to make that move. But there are also a few [suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs) and [neighborhoods](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs) in the Nashville area where you can get a great deal.

This will mean you can find good deals on houses and land, but you will not find every amenity in town. You can get to Nashville amenities in around half an hour. Kingston Springs is also an excellent option for those wanting a deal near Nashville. If you’re an outdoor enthusiast, this tight-knit community is on the Harpeth River. This is the perfect river for a float or kayak ride in the summer. There’s also a free splash pad at Burns Park that kids love to flock to in the summer, and you will also love Skyking Pizza as well. Don’t sleep on Kingston Springs, where great deals still exist.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Kingston Springs.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)\n\n### Watertown\n\nWatertown is another rural town in Nashville’s orbit. Watertown is east of Nashville near Lebanon. Like Kingston Springs, you will have to drive to find many amenities. But the tradeoff is that you can get some serious land and house for your money. Average home prices start at $275,000, and this is an affordable option for those looking for some wide-open space. Watertown’s sleepy small-town vibes are the perfect way to unwind, and the town is home to an old-school drive-in movie theater called The Stardust.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Watertown.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/watertown)\n\n### Murfreesboro\n\nIf country living isn’t for you, try Murfreesboro for an affordable option.

With its larger size, Murfreesboro offers all of the amenities of a smaller city.

Here are the top reasons why people move.","body":"Moving. The word itself conjures a maddening cocktail of excitement and stress, and once it’s on your mind, it’s hard to turn away from. In the United States, where progress and action are part of the cultural soul, the relocation urge is particularly strong. Perhaps that’s why every year around 10%-12% of Americans find a new home, and a large portion of those people change cities entirely. Thinking a [new city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-nashville) might be just the thing for you? Here are the top reasons why people make finding a different town part of their next move.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## To Be Close To Loved Ones\n\nWe go on and on about our hopes, dreams, and ambitions, but more often than not the most powerful force in our lives is those we care about. It’s no surprise, then, that they’re one of the key reasons we move.\n\nFirst, for so many reasons, we move for family. People looking to settle down and buy a house—especially when they’re [thinking of having kids](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families)—move with that family support system in mind. Many also move because they’re the ones providing the support. In 2016, almost 72% of Americans lived close to where they grew up, and of these people, 50% cited family as the main reason for that decision. We may not be able to live with ‘em, but living without ‘em is just not ideal.\n\nLong-distance romantic relationships are also not ideal, which is why people move to be closer to the one they love. In 2019, 10% of marriages started as long-distance relationships, and 75% of engaged couples had done long-distance at some point. By definition, at least half of the couple has to move to make it work, which means a lot of people relocating for love. \n\nRomance doesn’t have to be part of the equation, though. Moving near friends is a great way to build a support system, get to know a city, and maybe even split the rent. It’s not necessarily the most popular relocation motivation, but young people, especially, might only need that one ally to decide to take on a new locale.\n\n## Job Opportunity\n\n30 years ago this would have been number one on the list. Since the ‘80s, however, when 40% of job seekers ended up switching cities, more and more people are managing to stay put. As of 2018, only 10% of job seekers in the U.S. had to move because of work. Location just doesn’t matter as much as it used to. If this pandemic-stricken time has taught us anything, it’s that many people—especially those with technology-based, white-collar jobs—can [work from just about anywhere](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/tips-for-working-from-home). As of August 2020, 38% of college-educated workers were completely remote, and many others worked hybrid schedules that split time between home and the office. \n\nThe last two decades have also seen a rise in the gig economy. This broad sector of the workforce basically includes everyone who gets paid for the completion of a single project or task, casually known as a gig. Gigs can be as short as an Uber ride or as long as a multi-year project. What they all have in common, though, is their abrupt and predetermined end. Many gig workers, even if they have to work somewhere else in the short-term, return to an established home base. Often, however, they can fully complete and submit their assignments virtually, which means they work from just about anywhere. The reality is if you have a decent WiFi connection (and can stand the way you look on Zoom), there’s a good chance you can live wherever you want. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Livability\n\nAs people’s job situations become more flexible, livability plays a larger role in their moving decision. If you can choose where you live, why not find the very best place for your lifestyle? The most livable places provide all you want without costing you too much time and money. This can be tricky, because one person’s paradise could be another’s purgatory. Some cities, however, have mass appeal at the right price.\n\nPeople with livability in mind are quickly abandoning those bigger cities that were once necessary for employment. Spots like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco—known as tier 1 cities for their developed economic and cultural scenes—used to be final destinations. These days, though, people seek lower taxes, a cheaper mortgage, more space, and less traffic—they essentially want somewhere more livable. Consequently, newcomers are flooding tier 2 cities, like Dallas, Phoenix, Portland, Atlanta and [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville). Since 2010, Dallas’s population has risen by 1.2 million, while the Atlanta metro area has added over 700,000 people.\n\nOn the flip side, in 2017, NYC and LA lost a combined 209,000 in total population; and that was before the pandemic, which is already driving people from crowded places in greater numbers. It’s not difficult to see why. Even though tier two cities aren’t cheap, you can live in a 4-bedroom house in Nashville—a renowned spot for entertainment and culture—for the same amount you’d pay to rent a studio apartment in New York City. And those who can’t stand another hour sitting on an LA interstate might trade their commute for the convenience of a place like Charlotte, NC.\n\nIt’s all relative, however. Some residents of tier two cities faced with a population influx have already started moving to tier three cities—think Chattanooga, TN, or Bend, OR—that still promise the quieter life they used to enjoy in larger towns. Whatever the reason, people are pursuing livability like never before, which makes it one of the top reasons for moving.\n\n## Climate\n\nAs silly and frivolous as this may sound, people sometimes just can’t stand the [weather](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). This helps explain why the Northeast holds over half of the top ten states people want to leave. Meanwhile, the South keeps experiencing population gains. Weather wears on people, especially as they age. Baby Boomers, who are hitting retirement age at almost 10,000 per day, increasingly flock to sunny havens like Arizona and Florida. [Retirement](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee) , though, isn’t the only way to justify breaking up with your weather forecast. As job prospects increase in other parts of the country, like the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest, it’s never been easier to talk yourself into moving to a milder climate. \n\n## Education\n\nCollege may fly by, but four years is a long time to spend in one place. Tack on a little grad school, and you’re essentially a tenured resident. It might just be a home away from home for many, but college still counts as a significant move. In 2018, there were almost 20 million college students in the U.S., and around half of them migrated over an hour away from home. Some turn this into an earnest relocation, never leaving their college town. Still others use this first move as a springboard to launch them into new and unanticipated cities. Either way, that college choice is a key first move that often puts people on the cycle of relocation for years to come.\n\nThinking of relocating?

The more and more we drive around the downtown Nashville area, the more license plates we see from all across America. People from the northeast, midwest and even southeast are flocking to Tennessee in the masses, and for good reason. The mild climate, lower cost of housing, good healthcare facilities, and pretty views of the great smoky mountains make Tennessee a [great place in terms of quality of life](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee). **But did you know Tennessee is also one of the best states for retirees?**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Why Is Tennessee A Good State For Retirees?\n\nMore and more retirees are coming to The Volunteer State to live out their golden years. Retirees find this state a great location to call home for numerous reasons.\n\n### Affordable housing and cost of living\n\nOverall, Tennessee has an [affordable cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee). The basic rules of supply and demand will apply here as well, and as more people enter the state, and very few leave, house prices are certainly expected to rise. That said, you can still get a lot of bang for your buck as the median household price is still affordable and new homes are being developed in popular cities such as Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Have you been thinking about living in Tennessee? Check out our comprehensive local guide.](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### The tax rates are favorable\n\nSeldom do the words taxes and favorable go together, but in the case of Tennessee, they do! There is no [capital gains tax](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-when-selling-a-home-in-tennessee) on your retirement income. So if you have a pension from another state, or you're living off of your 401k income, moving here will be a great way to put more money in your pocket. Who doesn't want to do that? In addition to no state income tax, the overall property tax rates are on the lower end. On average, the effective tax rate on your property is 0.74%. Although [Davidson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county), which the city of Nashville is located in just increased property taxes by 34%, they are still competitive with growing metropolitan cities like Charlotte and Atlanta. This low rate is difficult to pass up compared to other areas in the nation.\n\n### The mild climate\n\nThe northeast can see bitter cold winters and the south can be excessively hot in the summer. [Tennessee is a nice blend of both extremes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). Our climate is mild. We get the beautiful 4 seasons, but our winters are not nearly as cold as our friends up north, and our summers are not as humid as the more southern states. Seeing as most retirees prefer warmer climates, this makes Tennessee a great option to consider!\n\n### Tennessee has a beautiful landscape\n\nThe beauty in Tennessee is hard to describe. There is arguably nothing prettier than having the great smoky mountains as a backdrop or [living along the hundreds of lakeshore miles](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-a-waterfront-property-in-tennessee) throughout the state. Tennessee is also known for its rolling hills and open farmland.\n\n### Our culture and history\n\nCountry music, southern hospitality, and a slower pace of life are certainly popular attributes that catch the hearts of most retirees. Our cities still have that small-town feel, but provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. The list goes on and on. There are so many reasons why people consider retiring in Tennessee. The only difficult decision is [finding the right town or city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) to call home!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Best Place To Retire In Tennessee?\n\nThis is one of the questions we get asked a lot at Felix Homes. There are plenty of great cities to live in, or near, picking between popular cities like Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville is nearly impossible. Instead of choosing just one, we collected our list of the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\nBefore we get into the list, if you're searching for the best [retirement communities in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-retirement-communities-tennessee), we wrote another article specifically focusing on that. But, if you're just hoping to live out your retirement years in Tennessee, and not necessarily searching for a retirement community, here is a list of our top 10 places you should considering spending your retirement years.\n\n### #10 - Chattanooga\nIf you want to embrace mother nature and all her beauty, consider moving to Chattanooga. Between the banks of the Tennessee River and Appalachian mountains, you'll be surrounded by beauty 365 days a year. Not only is Chattanooga a pretty place to call home, but it is also well known for being affordable. The median home value is $230,000 per year.\n\n### #9 - Memphis\nDespite having a population of over 650,000 people, Memphis still very much feels like a small country town. Situated on the great Mississippi River, Memphis has a unique character that cannot be duplicated in any other city on our list. There are plenty of activities to do inside of the city, or if you're looking for a more laid back lifestyle in your retirement years, the suburbs of Memphis and neighboring communities make for a great place to call home. The median home value is on the low end, so you'll really be able to stretch your retirement dollar here!\n\n### #8 - Murfreesboro\nWell known for its American Civil War History, Murfreesboro makes our list at spot number eight. The affordable median home price of $250,000, and affordable tax rates, make this area a great place for retirees to live. Retired residents can enjoy playing golf at the Old Fort Golf Club, or relax at one of the beautiful outdoor parks. The large Middle Tennessee State University campus keeps the city young at heart, and you'll enjoy plenty of entertainment, shows, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Murfreesboro.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Knoxville\nSituated just an hour north of the great smoky mountains national park, and home to the legendary University of Tennessee college football team, Knoxville surely makes our list of best places to retire in Tennessee. The city of Knoxville is located in East Tennessee and is nearly 1/4 the size of Memphis with a population of 180,000 people. Housing is rather affordable with the average home price being $215,000.\n\n### #6 - Nashville\nLocated in Davidson County, Nashville has our heart and is arguably the gem of Tennessee. There's no question Nashville makes our list of best places to retire. The residents here not only enjoy an international airport which makes traveling convenient, but they are also spoiled with amazing food choices, an endless amount of live entertainment, over 100 parks, and plenty of social clubs and recreation activities all across the city. Between the art scene, and the birthplace of country music, this is undoubtedly amongst the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-nashville-tennessee)**\n\n### #5 - Oak Hill\nAlthough this area is more expensive than other areas of Tennessee, Oak Hill is attracting more and more retirees. This is far enough outside of Nashville if you're seeking a laid back lifestyle, but just a short drive into the city where you can enjoy tons of shows, plays, concerts, restaurants, and museums.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like living in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-oak-hill-in-nashville)**\n\n### #4 - Pigeon Forge / Gatlinburg\nJust 40 minutes west of the North Carolina border sits Pigeon Forge. We promise, there is nothing more satisfying than having your morning coffee on your back deck overlooking the natural beauty of the great smoky mountains. No matter the season, the smoky mountains of Tennessee will always be a magnificent sight to see. Pigeon Forge is a small town that is well known for its amazing retirement benefits. The low cost of living, pretty views, and ease of access in and out of larger cities, makes this one of the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n### #3 - Franklin\nWhy is Franklin one of the best places to retire in Tennessee? Franklin is not only a historically rich town, it's also an affluent town. The active downtown surely promises a great culture. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, museums, and a fantastic music culture, Franklin is nothing shy of an amazing place to be. Your life can be as active as you'd like. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from. From walking trails, various parks, and several public golf courses, it's no secret why the population is on the rise!\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our Franklin neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Kingston Springs\nKingston Springs is a beautiful town located in Cheatham County just 20 miles southwest of the big city (Downtown Nashville). The population is shy of 6,000 residents. Residents of Kingston Springs love the several outdoor adventures this rural town provides. Between hiking, fishing in the river, golf, or canoeing, you won't be bored here. Kingston Springs is an incredibly safe place to be with a very low crime rate. Better yet, if the outdoor activities do not keep you busy, you can drive 25 minutes to Downtown Nashville and enjoy all this large metropolitan city has to offer. Most homes in Cheatham County are on over an acre of land so Kingston Springs is our pick for retirees who prefer some privacy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)**\n\n### #1 - Tellico Lake\nThe Tellico Lake community tops our list as the best place to retire and for good reason. Anywhere along Tellico Lake is nothing shy of a dream. The lake is 33 miles long and provides over 357 miles of beautiful shoreline. Entertainment and recreation activities are endless. Between boating, fishing, golfing, hiking, and walking trails, you'll love spending your life on the lake! Roughly an hour drive to the smoky mountains and half an hour away from Knoxville, Tellico Lake provides the best of both worlds.\n\n## Areas To Avoid\nNow that we covered the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee, what are some places you should avoid?\n\n### Davidson County\nWhile the city of Nashville is located in Davidson County, if you're looking to avoid rising property taxes in your retirement years, we would suggest looking for homes outside of county limits. If you're able to put up with [higher property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike), Davidson County has a lot to offer.\n\n### Dyersburg\nDyersburg is one of the cities we'd recommend you avoid. With a population of roughly 17,000, it's surprising how high the crime rate is compared to the national average. The city has struggled to expand and develop over the years. It's located on the west end of Tennessee, and hours away from vibrant, culturally rich, cities.\n\n### Jackson\n70 miles east of Memphis is Jackson Tennessee. Unfortunately, Jackson makes the top 100 most dangerous cities in America list. Much of the city has a household income below the poverty line.\n\n## Looking To Retire In Tennessee?\nIf you're looking to retire in Tennessee, we're here to help.

Location. Location.\n\nBut what exactly does location mean, and why is it so important? Location isn't just about the street the property is located on, although that plays a major role. The location also includes; the town, the proximity the home is to various amenities, and how safe the neighborhood is. Why is this so important? You can change the color of your house, update the kitchen, and add an extra bathroom. But you can't change the location of the home. Safety is a key piece to this puzzle, and we've compiled a list of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked?\n\nBefore we dive into the list of safest places to live in Tennessee, let's first define what safety means, and how a city or town tracks its safety level. There are two main crime statistics that are tracked; violent crimes and property crimes. A key thing to note is that crime rates are benchmarked per 1,000 residents. For example, if 'the violent crime rate in a city is 2 per 1,000.' That simply means, on average, 2 in every 1,000 people are victims of a violent crime. \n\n### Violent Crimes\n\nAccording to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime), violent crimes are \"composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as those offenses which involve a threat of force.\" A town with a low violent crime rate will have fewer reported violent crimes per year. \n\n### Property Crimes\n\nThe [FBI defines](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/property-crime) property crimes as the following offenses; \"burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.\" A town with a low property crime rate will have fewer instances of these crimes being reported per year. \n\nIf you're looking for the [best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee) or the [best places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee), you should be looking for a town with low property crime and violent crime rates! \n\n[**PRO TIP: Is The Volunteer State calling your name?

Everything about Brentwood screams luxury, especially the [high-end homes and mansions](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood/luxury-homes). From the small-town feel to their [award-winning public school system](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts), families from all over want to live here! Undoubtedly, this suburb is often considered one of the safest places to live in all of Tennessee. \n\nIt should be no surprise that the safety and luxury Brentwood offers come at a premium. The median income is among the highest in the state and the median home price can cost you over $750,000. The population of this town is just over 42,000 residents, and the crime rates are low! \n\nThe violent crime rate per 1,000 is just 0.89, which is well below Tennessee's average of 5.95! Not only is the violent crime rate low, but the property crime rate is also well below the national median. Coming in at 8.74 per 1,000 residents, it's clear this gorgeous town surely ranks as one of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\nThe town's own police department does a great job and law enforcement is present in the public schools, patrolling the downtown area, and will even attend sporting events. This suburb deserves its reputation as one of Tennessee's safest cities.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Brentwood neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-brentwood-tennessee)**\n\n### Franklin\n\nAnother Williamson County town hits the list. Franklin is a suburb of Nashville (Tennessee's largest city). Franklin is just south of Brentwood and is a little larger, with over 80,000 residents. This larger size brings more amenities. Franklin is also home to a quaint and historic downtown area. \n\nFranklin's crime rate is 47% below the national crime rate. Most crimes that occur in Franklin relate to property and theft.

The town's population is just shy of 10,000 residents, with a house median income of roughly $90,000. Most residents own their homes and the average home price is an affordable $231k. \n\nAccording to an FBI report, this town is considered one of Tennessee's safest cities. The chances of being a victim of a violent crime are low, coming in at 96.7 per capita. \n\nA nonviolent crime, such as vehicle theft or property damage, is a rare occurrence in this small town. On the crime index scale, property crime in Atoka received a score of 17.4, whereas the state of Tennessee received a score of 42.8. Remember, the lower the score, the better. \n\n**PRO TIP: [See the pros and cons of moving to Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-tennessee)**\n\n### Hendersonville\n\n![Image of Old Hickory Lake in Hendersonville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Old_Hickory_36592b6520.jpg)\n\nSituated on Old Hickory lake is the gorgeous family-orientated community of Hendersonville. This town is located just 20 miles north of Nashville and is considered one of Tennessee's safest cities. The town's population is roughly 57,000 people. Residents of Hendersonville not only enjoy an endless amount of water activities, but they also enjoy phenomenal schools and a gorgeous downtown. \n\nThe cost of living is higher here, but you pay for what you get. The crime data suggests the residents of this town appreciate a great deal of safety with their day-to-day lives. [Homes in Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville) typically cost between $350,000 - $650,000.\n\nData from 2020 suggests the violent crime rate here is nearly half the national U.S. average! And property crime is also well below the national average. Law enforcement patrols 500 miles of roadway and the 40+ square miles that make up the lakeside town. The [Hendersonville police department](https://hvillepd.org/) has over 90 patrol vehicles as well. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's our Hendersonville neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-hendersonville-tennessee)**\n\n### Maryville\n\nSouth of Knoxville is the town of Maryville Tennessee located in Blount County. The population of this town is roughly 24,000 residents. Most of the residents that live in this town commute to Knoxville for work and the median home cost is below the USA average. This goes to show that you don't need to break the bank in order to live in a safe town.\n\nCrimes per 1,000 are certainly low by any standard.

Oak Ridge, Clarksville,  Collegedale, and Collierville are all considered desirable places to live within Tennessee and provide a sense of comfort and security.\n\n## Is Tennessee A Safe State?\n\nMany people are proud to call Tennessee home. This is for good reason. The state has a favorable tax system, a mild climate, and is in a convenient location. Not only that, for the most part, this state is a safe place to live! Of course, there are some parts of the state that inflate the overall crime rate, and we'll touch on that below. \n\nThe safest area of Tennessee is located in the suburbs just outside of Nashville. Many of the suburbs listed above are all within 40 minutes of Nashville. Our pick for the safest city in Tennessee is Brentwood!\n\n## What States Are Considered The Safest In The U.S.?\n\nThe North East is well known for being the safest part of the country. Maine is the safest state, but Vermont is a close second. New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut are all in the top 10 safest states in America. \n\n## How Does Nashville Compare To Similar Cities?\n\nHow does Nashville stack up against other well-known cities? Overall, Nashville ranks safer than Atlanta from both a property and violent crime rate. However, Austin, Denver, and Charlotte all have a slight safety advantage. \n\n## What Are The Top 10 Safest Cities In The U.S.?\n\nAccording to [safe wise](https://www.safewise.com/safest-cities-america/), the top 10 safest cities in America are:\n\n1. Broadview Heights, Ohio\n2. Hopkinton, Massachusetts\n3. Oakland Township, Michigan\n4. Ridgefield, Connecticut\n5. Bergenfield, New Jersey\n6. New Castle Town, New York\n7. Franklin, Massachusetts\n8. Bedford Town, New York\n9. Shrewsbury, Massachusetts\n10. Bernards Township, New Jersey\n \n\n## What Cities In Tennessee Are The Least Safe?\n\nNow that we covered what are the safest areas in Tennessee, let's review the more dangerous areas. \n\n### Johnson City\n\nJohnson City has a crime rate of 41 per 1000, making it one of the highest crime rates in America compared to other communities of the same size. Property crime is also common, impacting nearly one person per every 24! \n\n### Memphis\n\nA 2020 study suggested Memphis Tennessee was ranked the most dangerous city in the country! The crime rate is 81 per 1,000 residents. \n\n### Dyersburg\n\nDyersburg has one of the highest crime rates in Tennessee and compared to cities of the same size across the country, its safety rating isn't looking good. The crime rate is 67 per 1,000 - well above the national median.\n\n### Nashville Metro\n\nThe crime rate for the Nashville Metro is 54 per 1,000. Unfortunately, despite the wonderful music and food culture this city has to offer, crime does not stay away. That said, not all neighborhoods in the Nashville metro have a high crime rate. Neighborhoods such as Green Hills, Sylvan Park, or Oak Hill are safe. The overall Nashville crime rate gets dragged down by up-and-coming neighborhoods such as [North Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-north-nashville), [Antioch](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-antioch-in-nashville), or parts of [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-east-nashville).\n\n### Jackson\n\nLocated on the western side of the state is Jackson Tennessee.

It'll help you decide if moving to Tennessee should be your next adventure, and provide insight into the best spots to call home.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Major Cities In Tennessee?\n\nTennesseans aren't ones to brag, but they have more than their fair share of cities to be proud of. Unlike towns in some other areas of the U.S., each of the state's population centers has its own distinct character, landscape, and appeal. From Memphis along the Mississippi to Knoxville in the Appalachians, Tennessee offers a nearly unparalleled combination of unique cities.\n\n### Nashville\n\n![Image of two girls standing in front of a mural in Nashville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Nashville_mural_e93790fb88.jpg)\n\nThere are a number of reasons that [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville) headlines Tennessee's urban lineup. The capital city is right in the middle of the state and has the highest metro population, of nearly 2 million residents. It's not just the hub of Tennessee, but also one of the Southeast's cultural centerpieces. The nightlife, whether on Broadway, at Five Points, or any of the city's other social hotspots, is unparalleled. Apart from that, Nashville's collection of colleges (including Vanderbilt University), and historical icons like the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium, lend the city a nearly endless inventory of attractions. Perhaps that's why it's one of the fastest-growing cities in the entire U.S. If you're thinking about [moving to Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-nashville) specifically, check our guide on what makes the music city a great place.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our picks for the top 10 suburbs in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-suburbs-of-nashville-real-estate)**\n\n### Knoxville\n\nThis valley town, nestled between the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, has been a nucleus of Appalachian life for generations. From its location along the Tennessee River, a town that began as a clearinghouse for the mountains' natural resources, evolved into a regional center for tourism and Appalachian culture. Today it's home to the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, the state's flagship university, and many landmarks, like the Tennessee Theatre and the \"Sunsphere\" from the 1982 World's Fair. And even though the fair may have left town, Knoxville remains one of Tennessee's great destinations.\n\n### Memphis\n\n![Image of a man and a woman standing in front of a sign that says the words \"Memphis\"](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/moving_to_tennessee_1_da2e4d1156_b8def6d923.jpg)\n\nNashville may have the shiniest music scene, but Memphis, along the banks of the Mississippi River, will always be the ancestral home of the blues. The neon lights of Beale Street still illuminate live music played in the same places where names like Elvis, Cash, and Aretha got their start. To this day, millions of Elvis Presley's admirers make their way to Graceland, his mansion, to pay tribute to The King of Rock N' Roll. Yet, Memphis is about more than just music. FedEx calls the city home, thus continuing Memphis's long-standing reputation as a transportation hub. And the National Civil Rights Museum is also there, in recognition of the town's tragic past (Memphis is the site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination) and hopeful future. Plus, you will never go hungry with the food scene and bbq around town.\n\n### Chattanooga\n\nChattanooga is a smaller city that sits on the state border of Georgia and Tennessee. This railroad town has always been notable for its contributions to the Southern manufacturing economy and its key role in the Civil War, but lately, it has also evolved into a haven for tourism. Destinations like Ruby Falls, Rock City (have you seen it?), and the Tennessee Aquarium make Chattanooga one of the best visits in the state. It also doesn't hurt that its position along the Tennessee River, right at the foot of the Appalachians, is about as picturesque as it gets. Since the TVA created a reservoir system to keep the valley from flooding, Chattanooga has been able to develop into a city worthy of its beautiful location.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The History Of Tennessee?\n\nTennessee started out as part of North Carolina but gained statehood in 1796. It didn't get its nickname, \"The Volunteer State\", until the War of 1812, when droves of the state's residents fought to defend the young United States. This sense of duty continued during the Mexican-American War and the Civil War when Tennessee had the paradoxical distinction of supplying the most Confederate and Union regiments of any Confederate state. Tennessee has historically been known for its diverse natural resources and economic landscape. Until the early 1900s, when railroad development rendered steamboats mostly obsolete, Memphis was the premier stop along the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the eastern part of the state was functioning as a hub for marble, iron, coal, and other natural resources provided by the mountains. During the Great Depression, when the TVA started turning Tennessee into the nation's largest supplier of public utilities, the state really started to take off economically. The Manhattan Project even created a research facility in the state that used the ample power for missile development. Alongside all this, Tennessee gained a reputation as an artistic and travel hub that is still drawing many visitors today.\n\n## What Is Tennessee Know For?\n\nTennessee's reputation, frankly, defies summarization. It's a music-loving, football-crazy, history-filled state with more attractions and features than one could see in a lifetime. Its system of rivers and lakes rivals any in the country, and its mountains boast some of the highest peaks east of the Rockies. On top of that, four distinct cities each provide a different way to experience the state. However, if we have to choose, Tennessee is probably most notable for...\n\n### The Smoky Mountains\n\nSince The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established in 1934, it has put Tennessee on the map as a place of accessible natural beauty. The Appalachian Trail runs right through the park along the TN-NC border and offers just a taste of the unbelievable hiking the area has to offer. It's the most-visited national park in the country, and the state has done a wonderful job complementing the natural world with some beloved entertainment options. Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge are both prime mountain tourist destinations just outside the park's borders. Gatlinburg is essentially a carnival in the Appalachians, with its own aquarium, huge ropes courses, and SkyBridge, the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in North America. Pigeon Forge, its neighbor and tourism rival, has its own long list of attractions headlined by Dollywood, the theme park based on the state's own Dolly Parton.\n\n### Country Music\n\n![Image of people standing inside the country music hall of fame located in downtown Nashville](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HOF_6fc8fe9dc8.jpg)\n\nTennessee may be the home of the Blues, but country music defines its reputation today. Some of the earliest country music, with its signature fiddle, came out of the state's mountains. Now, the genre calls Nashville home. Dozens of stars, like Taylor Swift (we still count her!), Jason Isbell, and Chris Stapleton, reside in and around Nashville, with more moving in every day. The Ryman Auditorium, the Bluebird Cafe, and the Grand Ole Opry are just a few of the signature spots for live shows. With modern venues like the Ascend Amphitheater and the Country Music Hall of Fame popping up seemingly every year, country music isn't finding a new home any time soon.\n\n## How's The Cost Of Living In Tennessee?\n\nLike any large area, the [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) will vary based on the city. In general, though, Tennessee is quite reasonable compared to most of the country. \n\n### Which parts of Tennessee have a low cost of living?\n\nIn general, your dollar goes further in smaller towns. In fact, eight Tennessee towns rank in the top 100 for [best places to relocate to](https://www.movebuddha.com/blog/popular-small-city-list/). When there are fewer residents and more space, housing costs tend to be lower. That's why places like Johnson City and Clarksville boast living costs well below the national average and have positioned themselves as pleasant, inexpensive places to live. Lucky for Tennessee, even more-populated areas are still very affordable. Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis, for instance, are relatively cheap mainly because of their reasonable housing costs. This makes Tennessee one of the rare states where you can get cosmopolitan living without high-end prices.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See The Top 10 Most Affordable Nashville Suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs)**\n\n### Which parts of Tennessee have a high cost of living?\n\nJust about the only locale in Tennessee where the cost of living slides above the national average is Nashville. This isn't some huge surprise. Nashville has some of the nicest neighborhoods and homes in the entire country, with entertainment and amenities to match. Considering everything it has to offer, it's remarkable that the Nashville-metro area's overall living costs are just barely higher than the national average. More affordable communities outside Nashville, like Murfreesboro, make living in Nashville more attainable.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See The 20 Most Exclusive Neighborhoods In Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-nashville)**\n\n## How's The Economy In Tennessee?\n\nTennessee's economy was in the midst of an unprecedented upswing when the pandemic hit. The unemployment rate was at a record-low 3.3%, corporations were flourishing, and tourism was thriving. Even as those economic indicators take a hit, though, Tennessee's economy has still gracefully withstood the pressures of 2020. The state's unemployment is around 5%, and job creation has continued. Many aspects of life over the past 12 months may have changed, but Tennessee's overall economic outlook has remained strong.\n\n### What are the pros of Tennessee's economy?\n\nCorporations are catching on to Tennessee for its favorable labor laws and exceptionally low state tax rates (including no state income tax!). A range of companies, including FedEx, International Paper, Dollar General, and Cracker Barrel have made the state their headquarters. Many more, like Tyson Chicken and Nissan, operate massive plants and other facilities within the state's borders. Besides its reputation as a corporate haven, Tennessee also draws millions of visitors every year. Nashville, Memphis, and the mountains combine to create a statewide swath of tourist attractions that draw lots of money into the state's borders.\n\n### What are the cons of Tennessee's economy?\n\nLike everywhere, Tennessee's small towns have seen their fair share of decay as money and talent clusters in the more urban areas. Out of all the state's big cities, Knoxville has shown limited job growth. While this may be a little troubling, the university and consistent tourism still give Knoxville a favorable economic floor.\n\n### How's the job market in Tennessee?\n\nThough Tennessee lags behind other parts of the country with average wages, you are likely not to notice due to the low cost of living. Major cities in Tennessee have large companies that bring many jobs. In Middle Tennessee, these include huge healthcare companies like HCA, Community Health Systems, Vanderbilt, and Saint Thomas. Other big players in Nashville include Nissan, Vanderbilt University, Asurion, and Amazon. Outside of Nashville, major employers also include Fed- Ex in Memphis and Oak Ridge Labratory in Knoxville.\n\n## How Are The Schools In Tennessee?\n\n### Top school districts in Tennessee\n\nConsidering Tennessee's diversity and size, the state maintains an impressive system of public education. Germantown, a suburb of Memphis, is considered the best overall school district, while just outside Knoxville, Maryville takes the second-place spot. The Arlington and Kingsport school districts are also top-notch, and various [Nashville suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts), like [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin), [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), and [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), have outstanding public and private schools. Franklin, Brentwood, Nolensville, and Spring Hill are all in Williamson County.\n\n### Top public schools in Tennessee\n\nThe state's best public high schools tend to belong to big city suburbs, particularly the ones that surround Nashville. US News ranks Merrol Hyde Magnet School in [Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville), a suburb of Nashville, as the top high school in the state and a top-three school in the entire nation. High schools in and around Nashville take the first seven spots in the rankings, followed closely by specialized high schools from other areas, like Knoxville's L\u0026N Stem Academy.\n\n### Top private schools in Tennessee\n\nMost private schools are clustered around Memphis and Nashville, but nearly every major metropolitan area offers a great private school option for your child's education. According to Niche.com, the University School of Nashville and Memphis's St. Mary's Episcopal School receive the top marks. Chattanooga's Baylor School and the Webb School of Knoxville are great options in the state's slightly smaller locales. If you're looking at boarding school options, McCallie School just outside of Chattanooga is also a famous institution for all-boys education.\n\n## How Is The Real Estate Market In Tennessee?\n\nIt may have been a difficult year for the overall economy, but that hasn't stopped [Tennessee's booming real estate market](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-real-estate-market-update). People attracted by Tennessee's forgiving taxes, affordable living costs, and ample space are fleeing other states, and their presence is helping to drive the market higher across the boards. Every major metropolitan area has seen a considerable increase in average sale prices over the last year, and even smaller towns are starting to show nice upticks in home prices.\n\n### Are homes expensive in Tennessee?\n\nIn most towns, inexpensive homes are the primary reason that the state maintains such an accessible economic threshold for living. Home values in areas like Knoxville or Chattanooga, even though they've lately been rising, are still some of the best you'll find in a city. Many people find suitable homes for around, or even under, $200K. Those who move to Tennessee might be a little less thrilled by the 'big city' Nashville market, where average home prices hover just under $350K, with numerous areas reaching values considerably higher than that. This may not be music to your ears, especially if you're considering a move, but there's simply not a more desirable area in the state. Also, Nashville home values have consistently increased over the years, so despite the price, it remains a good investment.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See Nashville homes for sale](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville)**\n\n### How much are property taxes in Tennessee?\n\nTennessee's property taxes are famously low. Residents usually pay around half as much in property taxes per year as the average United States citizen. Exact property tax rates depend on the county (0.5% of the assessed value is a good estimate), but regardless of the location, property taxes make moving to Tennessee a particularly promising proposition.\n\n## Moving To Tennessee Pros And Cons\n\nOver the last 20 years, Tennessee has enjoyed an impressive rate of population growth. Low tax rates, living costs, and high quality of life have kept people on the move to Tennessee. It's not a perfect place, but for the price, Tennessee is about as good as one can get.\n\n### Top 5 Pros to moving to Tennessee\n\n#### **Low property taxes**\n\nWe'll say it again: Tennessee has one of the lowest property tax rates in the country, which makes it one of the best states to own property. If you plan on staying for a while, Tennessee's property tax policy will keep money in your pocket for years to come.\n\n#### **No state income tax**\n\nThat's right, there's no state income tax, so you get to keep as much of what you earn as possible. That's why your income goes as far in Tennessee as just about any other area in the country. The state compensates for this income tax break with a higher-than-average sales tax (around 7%). This ensures that Tennessee's visitors help the residents cover a large chunk of their living costs.\n\n#### **Low cost of living**\n\nLow taxes tend to mean low living expenses as well. Between this favorable tax structure and reasonable real estate prices, the result is a place where you know your income and savings work hard for you. Wherever you're living in Tennessee, chances are your daily expenses are well below the national average. And even if you're looking to move to Nashville, you won't be paying much more than the average American.\n\n#### **Tennessee mountains and lakes**\n\nTennessee is home to dozens of large and beautiful lakes, some of which are situated close to urban areas. The Nashville suburbs, for instance, are home to Old Hickory Lake and the Percy Priest Reservoir. While these lakes are distributed across the state, a multitude of them is nestled amongst the beautiful Appalachian Mountains, where multiple peaks rise well over 6,000 feet. These offer some of the best hiking and scenery in the entire United States. It's all the perfect place for a boating enthusiast.\n\n#### **Mild climate**\n\nTennessee's climate is one of the most comfortable in the country. Although average temperatures rise as you move farther west toward the Mississippi River, the entire state enjoys cool winters and long, warm summers. Most places, and especially the mountains, get the occasional snow and ice storm, but spring generally arrives quickly once March comes around.\n\n### Top 5 Cons to moving to Tennessee\n\n#### **Country music (unless you're a fan!)**\n\nCountry music is just a given in most parts of Tennessee. Live music is everywhere from hotels to bars to parks, and this isn't changing any time soon. If country music is what you want, then you're in the right place! Those who aren't fans of the genre, though, might not be so thrilled about the state's preferred soundtrack.\n\n#### **Cost of living is rising**\n\nTennessee's [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) is incredibly low, but it may not always stay that way. A few desirable areas, like Nashville, are slowly becoming more expensive. In fact, [Davidson County's property taxes increased 34% recently](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike). That said, most areas are unlikely to break your bank, but if you're looking to save money it's best to avoid the trendiest spots.\n\n#### **Landlocked state**\n\nIf you're all about coastal living or you have a \"Salt Life\" sticker on the back of your car, then Tennessee might not be what you're looking for. Tennessee may have its fair share of rivers and lakes although it's hours from sandy ocean beaches.\n\n#### **Humid climate**\n\nLet's just say that the term \"dry heat\" isn't something a lot of Tennesseans are familiar with. Tennessee's relative humidity is around 70%, which is middle of the pack within the U.S. However, combine that humidity rate with Southeastern summers and, well, it's not most people's idea of comfort. Luckily, those summers are still fairly mild for the Southeast, and over the years you'll appreciate how the extra moisture in the air keeps the drought risk minimal.\n\n#### **Slow to change**\n\nWe don't need to go through all the stereotypes, but generally, southern states has a tendency to move a little slower. This is sometimes a good thing, like when it comes to tinkering with your favorite hot chicken recipe. Sometimes though, it can be frustrating. New ideas take time to find a cultural foothold, whether they're as important as creating a more inclusive society, or as trivial as wishing you had a closer Chipotle. In fact, Tennessee is one of only ten states in the country where it is illegal for a real estate buyer's agent to offer their client a commission rebate ([although Felix Homes has a way around this](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee)). That doesn't mean, however, that Tennessee isn't trying to get with the times. Especially in urban areas, new types of people are coming to stay and bringing a fresh perspective with them. Tennessee is as open to change as ever and becoming more flexible in meeting every need...just don't mess with the hot chicken recipe.\n\n## Is Moving To Tennessee A Good Idea?\n\nWe don't know if [living in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) is your next step, but plenty of people have answered this question with a resounding yes! Job prospects are great, living costs are limited, and you'll never run out of things to do. Visitors often come for a weekend and realize immediately after leaving that they want to make Tennessee their home.\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for young professionals?\n\nIt's no secret what young professionals are looking for: nightlife, restaurants, convenience, and plenty of other young people to get to know. There are neighborhoods in cities like Chattanooga and Memphis that cater to this demographic, but for the [ultimate young professional lifestyle](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals), nothing compares to Nashville. The city's unparalleled neighborhood bar scene means that you don't have to venture downtown for a good night out, and plenty of chic rental properties make for accessible urban living. Then, if you want to hit the music and bar scene downtown, it's an easy 5 minute Uber ride. [The Nations](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-nations), [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills), [Germantown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/germantown), [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville), and [The Gulch](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-gulch) are just a few entries on the extensive list of convenient neighborhoods. Or you could just live [downtown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) with all the action right outside your window.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's The Top 6 Nashville Neighborhoods for Singles \u0026 Young Professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals)**\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for families?\n\nWe hate to keep going back to the old standby, but yet again we have to give the nod to [Nashville's Suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-suburbs-of-nashville-real-estate). It simply offers the most enticing combination of location, activities, schools, and properties. The best part is, there's a suburb for every budget. Neighborhoods like [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills), [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), and [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) are some of the best communities in the Southeast but can be prohibitively expensive. Luckily, areas like [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), and [Mount Juliet](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/mount-juliet) offer plenty of family-friendly features in a more affordable real estate market. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out the best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for retirees?\n\nThere are plenty of areas in Tennessee where retirees can stretch their dollars without sacrificing space and amenities. Which one you choose depends on the retirement lifestyle you would like to pursue. If you'd like to while away the years in the mountains, we suggest communities along Tellico Lake just south of Knoxville. Plenty of nice shorelines, large lots, and forgiving tax laws will keep you as comfortable as possible. For more urban-centric retirees, [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) really can't be beaten. Living costs are high, but it's a cultural hub with an astonishing restaurant and arts scene that certainly never gets old.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our top 10 places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee)**\n\n### Should you move from California to Tennessee?\n\nThat depends. New residents are coming from California every day. The factors pushing them to Tennessee are lower cost of living, less traffic, and shorter commutes. If that's appealing, a new Tennessee home may be for you. There are some downsides for Californians moving to Tennessee: tornadoes, no oceans, and a challenging market for buyers in many of Tennessee's most desirable areas.\n\n## Is Tennessee A Safe Place?\n\nNo area is perfectly safe, but we have to admit that some are safer than others, and perhaps no other factor is more important when considering where to move. Fortunately, Tennessee offers plenty of low-risk residential options that will tax your nerves about as much as they'll tax your income (a.k.a not at all).\n\n### What are the safest places to live in Tennessee?\n\nFrom a safety perspective, you can't go wrong with Nashville's premier suburbs. [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), and [Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs) are all havens situated around Tennessee's largest city. If you're thinking you'd like to go rural, though, then you'll have to see the vast tracts available in [Watertown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/watertown), just 40 miles East of Nashville. In the town of 1,700, crime is almost nonexistent.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our list of safest places to live in Tennessee in 2025](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### What are the most dangerous places to live in Tennessee?\n\nJust because you want to move to Tennessee doesn't mean there aren't places in the state you'd rather not live. Over the years, Memphis has developed a less-than-pleasant safety reputation. Unfortunately, it keeps proving that the rumors are true. There are safe places to live around Memphis, like Collierville and Germantown, but overall, Memphis sees considerably more violent crimes than any other location in Tennessee.\n\n## Conclusion–Should You Move To Tennessee?\n\nWell, it's time to deliver the verdict, and it looks like you should seriously consider moving to The Volunteer State. Living in Tennessee may not be for everyone, but if we're talking pros and cons, the advantages are staggering. Between the low cost of living, natural beauty, and endless activities, there has never been a better time to call the state home.\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is where five-star service meets low commissions!

The more and more we drive around the downtown Nashville area, the more license plates we see from all across America. People from the northeast, midwest and even southeast are flocking to Tennessee in the masses, and for good reason. The mild climate, lower cost of housing, good healthcare facilities, and pretty views of the great smoky mountains make Tennessee a [great place in terms of quality of life](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee). **But did you know Tennessee is also one of the best states for retirees?**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Why Is Tennessee A Good State For Retirees?\n\nMore and more retirees are coming to The Volunteer State to live out their golden years. Retirees find this state a great location to call home for numerous reasons.\n\n### Affordable housing and cost of living\n\nOverall, Tennessee has an [affordable cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee). The basic rules of supply and demand will apply here as well, and as more people enter the state, and very few leave, house prices are certainly expected to rise. That said, you can still get a lot of bang for your buck as the median household price is still affordable and new homes are being developed in popular cities such as Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Have you been thinking about living in Tennessee? Check out our comprehensive local guide.](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### The tax rates are favorable\n\nSeldom do the words taxes and favorable go together, but in the case of Tennessee, they do! There is no [capital gains tax](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-when-selling-a-home-in-tennessee) on your retirement income. So if you have a pension from another state, or you're living off of your 401k income, moving here will be a great way to put more money in your pocket. Who doesn't want to do that? In addition to no state income tax, the overall property tax rates are on the lower end. On average, the effective tax rate on your property is 0.74%. Although [Davidson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county), which the city of Nashville is located in just increased property taxes by 34%, they are still competitive with growing metropolitan cities like Charlotte and Atlanta. This low rate is difficult to pass up compared to other areas in the nation.\n\n### The mild climate\n\nThe northeast can see bitter cold winters and the south can be excessively hot in the summer. [Tennessee is a nice blend of both extremes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). Our climate is mild. We get the beautiful 4 seasons, but our winters are not nearly as cold as our friends up north, and our summers are not as humid as the more southern states. Seeing as most retirees prefer warmer climates, this makes Tennessee a great option to consider!\n\n### Tennessee has a beautiful landscape\n\nThe beauty in Tennessee is hard to describe. There is arguably nothing prettier than having the great smoky mountains as a backdrop or [living along the hundreds of lakeshore miles](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-a-waterfront-property-in-tennessee) throughout the state. Tennessee is also known for its rolling hills and open farmland.\n\n### Our culture and history\n\nCountry music, southern hospitality, and a slower pace of life are certainly popular attributes that catch the hearts of most retirees. Our cities still have that small-town feel, but provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. The list goes on and on. There are so many reasons why people consider retiring in Tennessee. The only difficult decision is [finding the right town or city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) to call home!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Best Place To Retire In Tennessee?\n\nThis is one of the questions we get asked a lot at Felix Homes. There are plenty of great cities to live in, or near, picking between popular cities like Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville is nearly impossible. Instead of choosing just one, we collected our list of the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\nBefore we get into the list, if you're searching for the best [retirement communities in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-retirement-communities-tennessee), we wrote another article specifically focusing on that. But, if you're just hoping to live out your retirement years in Tennessee, and not necessarily searching for a retirement community, here is a list of our top 10 places you should considering spending your retirement years.\n\n### #10 - Chattanooga\nIf you want to embrace mother nature and all her beauty, consider moving to Chattanooga. Between the banks of the Tennessee River and Appalachian mountains, you'll be surrounded by beauty 365 days a year. Not only is Chattanooga a pretty place to call home, but it is also well known for being affordable. The median home value is $230,000 per year.\n\n### #9 - Memphis\nDespite having a population of over 650,000 people, Memphis still very much feels like a small country town. Situated on the great Mississippi River, Memphis has a unique character that cannot be duplicated in any other city on our list. There are plenty of activities to do inside of the city, or if you're looking for a more laid back lifestyle in your retirement years, the suburbs of Memphis and neighboring communities make for a great place to call home. The median home value is on the low end, so you'll really be able to stretch your retirement dollar here!\n\n### #8 - Murfreesboro\nWell known for its American Civil War History, Murfreesboro makes our list at spot number eight. The affordable median home price of $250,000, and affordable tax rates, make this area a great place for retirees to live. Retired residents can enjoy playing golf at the Old Fort Golf Club, or relax at one of the beautiful outdoor parks. The large Middle Tennessee State University campus keeps the city young at heart, and you'll enjoy plenty of entertainment, shows, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Murfreesboro.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Knoxville\nSituated just an hour north of the great smoky mountains national park, and home to the legendary University of Tennessee college football team, Knoxville surely makes our list of best places to retire in Tennessee. The city of Knoxville is located in East Tennessee and is nearly 1/4 the size of Memphis with a population of 180,000 people. Housing is rather affordable with the average home price being $215,000.\n\n### #6 - Nashville\nLocated in Davidson County, Nashville has our heart and is arguably the gem of Tennessee. There's no question Nashville makes our list of best places to retire. The residents here not only enjoy an international airport which makes traveling convenient, but they are also spoiled with amazing food choices, an endless amount of live entertainment, over 100 parks, and plenty of social clubs and recreation activities all across the city. Between the art scene, and the birthplace of country music, this is undoubtedly amongst the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-nashville-tennessee)**\n\n### #5 - Oak Hill\nAlthough this area is more expensive than other areas of Tennessee, Oak Hill is attracting more and more retirees. This is far enough outside of Nashville if you're seeking a laid back lifestyle, but just a short drive into the city where you can enjoy tons of shows, plays, concerts, restaurants, and museums.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like living in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-oak-hill-in-nashville)**\n\n### #4 - Pigeon Forge / Gatlinburg\nJust 40 minutes west of the North Carolina border sits Pigeon Forge. We promise, there is nothing more satisfying than having your morning coffee on your back deck overlooking the natural beauty of the great smoky mountains. No matter the season, the smoky mountains of Tennessee will always be a magnificent sight to see. Pigeon Forge is a small town that is well known for its amazing retirement benefits. The low cost of living, pretty views, and ease of access in and out of larger cities, makes this one of the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n### #3 - Franklin\nWhy is Franklin one of the best places to retire in Tennessee? Franklin is not only a historically rich town, it's also an affluent town. The active downtown surely promises a great culture. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, museums, and a fantastic music culture, Franklin is nothing shy of an amazing place to be. Your life can be as active as you'd like. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from. From walking trails, various parks, and several public golf courses, it's no secret why the population is on the rise!\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our Franklin neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Kingston Springs\nKingston Springs is a beautiful town located in Cheatham County just 20 miles southwest of the big city (Downtown Nashville). The population is shy of 6,000 residents. Residents of Kingston Springs love the several outdoor adventures this rural town provides. Between hiking, fishing in the river, golf, or canoeing, you won't be bored here. Kingston Springs is an incredibly safe place to be with a very low crime rate. Better yet, if the outdoor activities do not keep you busy, you can drive 25 minutes to Downtown Nashville and enjoy all this large metropolitan city has to offer. Most homes in Cheatham County are on over an acre of land so Kingston Springs is our pick for retirees who prefer some privacy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)**\n\n### #1 - Tellico Lake\nThe Tellico Lake community tops our list as the best place to retire and for good reason.

Between boating, fishing, golfing, hiking, and walking trails, you'll love spending your life on the lake! Roughly an hour drive to the smoky mountains and half an hour away from Knoxville, Tellico Lake provides the best of both worlds.\n\n## Areas To Avoid\nNow that we covered the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee, what are some places you should avoid?\n\n### Davidson County\nWhile the city of Nashville is located in Davidson County, if you're looking to avoid rising property taxes in your retirement years, we would suggest looking for homes outside of county limits. If you're able to put up with [higher property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike), Davidson County has a lot to offer.\n\n### Dyersburg\nDyersburg is one of the cities we'd recommend you avoid. With a population of roughly 17,000, it's surprising how high the crime rate is compared to the national average. The city has struggled to expand and develop over the years. It's located on the west end of Tennessee, and hours away from vibrant, culturally rich, cities.\n\n### Jackson\n70 miles east of Memphis is Jackson Tennessee. Unfortunately, Jackson makes the top 100 most dangerous cities in America list. Much of the city has a household income below the poverty line.\n\n## Looking To Retire In Tennessee?\nIf you're looking to retire in Tennessee, we're here to help.

Here are the top reasons why people move.","body":"Moving. The word itself conjures a maddening cocktail of excitement and stress, and once it’s on your mind, it’s hard to turn away from. In the United States, where progress and action are part of the cultural soul, the relocation urge is particularly strong. Perhaps that’s why every year around 10%-12% of Americans find a new home, and a large portion of those people change cities entirely. Thinking a [new city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-nashville) might be just the thing for you? Here are the top reasons why people make finding a different town part of their next move.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## To Be Close To Loved Ones\n\nWe go on and on about our hopes, dreams, and ambitions, but more often than not the most powerful force in our lives is those we care about. It’s no surprise, then, that they’re one of the key reasons we move.\n\nFirst, for so many reasons, we move for family. People looking to settle down and buy a house—especially when they’re [thinking of having kids](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families)—move with that family support system in mind. Many also move because they’re the ones providing the support. In 2016, almost 72% of Americans lived close to where they grew up, and of these people, 50% cited family as the main reason for that decision. We may not be able to live with ‘em, but living without ‘em is just not ideal.\n\nLong-distance romantic relationships are also not ideal, which is why people move to be closer to the one they love. In 2019, 10% of marriages started as long-distance relationships, and 75% of engaged couples had done long-distance at some point. By definition, at least half of the couple has to move to make it work, which means a lot of people relocating for love. \n\nRomance doesn’t have to be part of the equation, though. Moving near friends is a great way to build a support system, get to know a city, and maybe even split the rent. It’s not necessarily the most popular relocation motivation, but young people, especially, might only need that one ally to decide to take on a new locale.\n\n## Job Opportunity\n\n30 years ago this would have been number one on the list. Since the ‘80s, however, when 40% of job seekers ended up switching cities, more and more people are managing to stay put. As of 2018, only 10% of job seekers in the U.S. had to move because of work. Location just doesn’t matter as much as it used to. If this pandemic-stricken time has taught us anything, it’s that many people—especially those with technology-based, white-collar jobs—can [work from just about anywhere](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/tips-for-working-from-home). As of August 2020, 38% of college-educated workers were completely remote, and many others worked hybrid schedules that split time between home and the office. \n\nThe last two decades have also seen a rise in the gig economy. This broad sector of the workforce basically includes everyone who gets paid for the completion of a single project or task, casually known as a gig. Gigs can be as short as an Uber ride or as long as a multi-year project. What they all have in common, though, is their abrupt and predetermined end. Many gig workers, even if they have to work somewhere else in the short-term, return to an established home base. Often, however, they can fully complete and submit their assignments virtually, which means they work from just about anywhere. The reality is if you have a decent WiFi connection (and can stand the way you look on Zoom), there’s a good chance you can live wherever you want. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Livability\n\nAs people’s job situations become more flexible, livability plays a larger role in their moving decision. If you can choose where you live, why not find the very best place for your lifestyle? The most livable places provide all you want without costing you too much time and money. This can be tricky, because one person’s paradise could be another’s purgatory. Some cities, however, have mass appeal at the right price.\n\nPeople with livability in mind are quickly abandoning those bigger cities that were once necessary for employment. Spots like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco—known as tier 1 cities for their developed economic and cultural scenes—used to be final destinations. These days, though, people seek lower taxes, a cheaper mortgage, more space, and less traffic—they essentially want somewhere more livable. Consequently, newcomers are flooding tier 2 cities, like Dallas, Phoenix, Portland, Atlanta and [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville). Since 2010, Dallas’s population has risen by 1.2 million, while the Atlanta metro area has added over 700,000 people.\n\nOn the flip side, in 2017, NYC and LA lost a combined 209,000 in total population; and that was before the pandemic, which is already driving people from crowded places in greater numbers. It’s not difficult to see why. Even though tier two cities aren’t cheap, you can live in a 4-bedroom house in Nashville—a renowned spot for entertainment and culture—for the same amount you’d pay to rent a studio apartment in New York City. And those who can’t stand another hour sitting on an LA interstate might trade their commute for the convenience of a place like Charlotte, NC.\n\nIt’s all relative, however. Some residents of tier two cities faced with a population influx have already started moving to tier three cities—think Chattanooga, TN, or Bend, OR—that still promise the quieter life they used to enjoy in larger towns. Whatever the reason, people are pursuing livability like never before, which makes it one of the top reasons for moving.\n\n## Climate\n\nAs silly and frivolous as this may sound, people sometimes just can’t stand the [weather](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). This helps explain why the Northeast holds over half of the top ten states people want to leave. Meanwhile, the South keeps experiencing population gains. Weather wears on people, especially as they age. Baby Boomers, who are hitting retirement age at almost 10,000 per day, increasingly flock to sunny havens like Arizona and Florida. [Retirement](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee) , though, isn’t the only way to justify breaking up with your weather forecast. As job prospects increase in other parts of the country, like the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest, it’s never been easier to talk yourself into moving to a milder climate. \n\n## Education\n\nCollege may fly by, but four years is a long time to spend in one place. Tack on a little grad school, and you’re essentially a tenured resident. It might just be a home away from home for many, but college still counts as a significant move. In 2018, there were almost 20 million college students in the U.S., and around half of them migrated over an hour away from home. Some turn this into an earnest relocation, never leaving their college town. Still others use this first move as a springboard to launch them into new and unanticipated cities. Either way, that college choice is a key first move that often puts people on the cycle of relocation for years to come.\n\nThinking of relocating?

These communities are **not nursing homes or long term care communities**, but rather a community filled with men and women enjoying their golden years while being able to take care of themselves.\n\nIn Tennessee, these communities typically include many amenities that will keep you happy and entertained. Common amenities include; a pool, a community center, and a fitness center. Some are even situated on a golf course or lakefront and promote an active adult lifestyle.\n\n### Is a retirement community the same as a 55+ community?\n\nThere are numerous 55+ communities in TN - are they the same as a retirement community? Yes, they are. More and more people are starting to realize the amazing benefits Tennessee has, whether you're raising a family or enjoying the golden years, Tennessee has it all.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the latest 55+ community homes for sale in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville/senior-community-homes)**\n\n## What Are The Benefits Of Retiring In Tennessee?\n\n[Tennessee is a fantastic place to live and retire](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee). In particular, the greater Nashville area is the most sought-after area in all of Tennessee. What's all the buzz and excitement about, and is it for good reason? It certainly is! Tennessee is becoming a leading retirement destination for numerous reasons:\n\n### The cost of living\n\nTennessee provides a [great bang for your buck](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee). Many people are choosing to leave the Northeast or West Coast, not only in search of a more desirable and mild climate but also because of the cost of living and tax advantages.\n\nTennessee is one of the few states that won't tax your retirement income. Retirees don't pay taxes on their IRA, pensions, or 401k income if they reside in Tennessee. You've paid income tax your entire life, it's now time to enjoy some tax benefits and stretch that dollar!\n\n### The culture\n\nNashville Tennessee is a culturally rich city. Nowhere else in Tennessee do you have such a great music scene, a wide selection of fantastic restaurants, and diverse nightlife. The residents embrace the southern charm and the city has a warm, welcoming feel.\n\n### The healthcare system\n\nWithout question, healthcare must be a major point of consideration when you're looking to enjoy your retirement years. Tennessee is well known for its excellent healthcare system. In fact, healthcare makes up the largest industry in Nashville with prominent hospitals and research facilities such as Vanderbilt University Medical Center or St. Thomas Hospital.\n\n### Ease of access\n\nWith just a short plane ride, you can be on the sandy beaches of southern Florida, or within the greater New York City or Boston metropolitan area. The airports in Tennessee are easy to access and can get you really anywhere in the country in just a short ride. Visiting family, old friends, or vacationing to another state will be a breeze!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What To Look For When Choosing A Retirement Community In Tennessee?\n\nFinding the right community is entirely contingent on what you're looking for. There are a wide range of communities you can choose from, such as;\n\n- **A golf centered community** - The homes in a golf centered community will be situated on a beautiful golf course. Live on the country club year-round and play golf any day of the week!\n- **Lakefront living** - If you love fishing or the outdoors, you may want to find yourself in a lakefront community. Between hiking, swimming in the lake, enjoying the beautiful views, and casting a line into the beautiful Tellico lake water off your own dock in the backyard, what's not to love?\n- **One with nature** - There's arguably nothing more relaxing and beautiful than enjoying a nice cup of coffee on your deck overlooking the great smoky mountains. If nature is your calling, be sure to check out communities that blend seamlessly with nature. Generally speaking, homes in these communities are a bit more spaced out, but still provide a close community lifestyle.\n- **Active adult communities** - The active adult communities are becoming increasingly popular as many folks want to get or stay healthy in their golden years. Between a fitness center, tennis courts, walking trails, the active adult communities are truly a fantastic place to be.\n- **Let's not forget about city living** - If you're into the hustle and bustle of a city, you can certainly find a community to complement your lifestyle. Catch a performance downtown and walk over to your favorite restaurant for dinner, you can do it all!\n\n\nIt's also important to consider the number of rules, regulations, and fees the community has. There can be various age restrictions, max home occupancy rules, and fees that are worth taking into consideration. You certainly want a community feel, but you may not be willing to compromise on some of the rules you'll be required to live by.\n\n\n### What's the cost of buying a house in a retirement community?\n\nBuying real estate in a Tennessee retirement community is certainly cheaper than in other areas of the country. Considering the amenities that come with these communities the price of a home is typically more expensive than buying a house outside of a community. Homes typically range from the mid $300,000's to over $1,000,000 on the high end and everything in between. The price of the home cannot be the only thing considered. You also must take into account the amenities!\n\nThese amenities and benefits also come at a price. Retirement communities will have monthly fees that must be paid to the association. These fees help pay for all the benefits and amenities you are provided. The fee typically covers; a grounds crew which will keep all properties looking like a resort at all times, the upkeep of the pool, gym, tennis courts, roads, and even some major exterior home repairs.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the latest 55+ community homes for sale in Franklin, Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin/senior-community-homes)**\n\n### What are some of the amenities typically offered in a 55+ community?\n\nTypically, a Tennessee retirement community will feel very much like a country club! Between a gym, clubhouse, beautiful lawns, mountain or lakefront views, golf courses, and beautiful new single-family homes or townhomes - you'll have no problem enjoying an active lifestyle\n\n### Is there a lot of maintenance for homeowners in a 55+ community?\n\nOwning a home in one of these communities can be a great experience. Typically, these homes are low maintenance, but not all. To start, many of the homes are new homes built by reputable builders. Additionally, the fees you pay each month will help cover a lot of maintenance expenses.\n\nYou may be able to throw away your lawnmower, as a professional grounds crew will tend to the lawn and make it look resort-quality all the time. The pool will be cleaned and maintained daily, the entertainment and gym center will always be cleaned and ready for use, and the roads will be well maintained.\n\nYou'll be free to tinker with the inside of the home as you choose.

Safety is a key piece to this puzzle, and we've compiled a list of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked?\n\nBefore we dive into the list of safest places to live in Tennessee, let's first define what safety means, and how a city or town tracks its safety level. There are two main crime statistics that are tracked; violent crimes and property crimes. A key thing to note is that crime rates are benchmarked per 1,000 residents. For example, if 'the violent crime rate in a city is 2 per 1,000.' That simply means, on average, 2 in every 1,000 people are victims of a violent crime. \n\n### Violent Crimes\n\nAccording to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime), violent crimes are \"composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as those offenses which involve a threat of force.\" A town with a low violent crime rate will have fewer reported violent crimes per year. \n\n### Property Crimes\n\nThe [FBI defines](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/property-crime) property crimes as the following offenses; \"burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.\" A town with a low property crime rate will have fewer instances of these crimes being reported per year. \n\nIf you're looking for the [best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee) or the [best places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee), you should be looking for a town with low property crime and violent crime rates! \n\n[**PRO TIP: Is The Volunteer State calling your name?

This is for good reason. The state has a favorable tax system, a mild climate, and is in a convenient location. Not only that, for the most part, this state is a safe place to live! Of course, there are some parts of the state that inflate the overall crime rate, and we'll touch on that below. \n\nThe safest area of Tennessee is located in the suburbs just outside of Nashville. Many of the suburbs listed above are all within 40 minutes of Nashville. Our pick for the safest city in Tennessee is Brentwood!\n\n## What States Are Considered The Safest In The U.S.?\n\nThe North East is well known for being the safest part of the country. Maine is the safest state, but Vermont is a close second. New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut are all in the top 10 safest states in America. \n\n## How Does Nashville Compare To Similar Cities?\n\nHow does Nashville stack up against other well-known cities? Overall, Nashville ranks safer than Atlanta from both a property and violent crime rate. However, Austin, Denver, and Charlotte all have a slight safety advantage. \n\n## What Are The Top 10 Safest Cities In The U.S.?\n\nAccording to [safe wise](https://www.safewise.com/safest-cities-america/), the top 10 safest cities in America are:\n\n1.

Franklin, Massachusetts\n8. Bedford Town, New York\n9. Shrewsbury, Massachusetts\n10.

Cool cities, beautiful scenery and plenty of jobs are some things that have attracted nearly 600,000 people to the state since 2010. Of course, there's also another factor: **cost of living**. [Living in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) has been a bargain for years, but just how affordable is the state? To find out, we've broken down how Tennessee scores on the elements that make up the cost of living index.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## How Is The Cost Of Living Index Calculated\n\nThis index is essentially a cost of living calculator that accounts for key living costs like food, healthcare, and housing, then compares those to the national average. The national average is expressed as 100. Numbers below that average represent a lower-than-average cost of living, while numbers above 100 express a higher cost of living. Each living cost is measured based on its relationship to that average. For instance, if food costs thirty cents less in Alaska than the average, then Alaska is assigned a food cost of 70. Once you've determined each living cost for a state, then you give weight to each category based on how much of a budget it tends to command. For instance, housing costs are weighted more heavily than food because they usually take up more of the budget. Finally, the weighted categories are averaged to determine the state's total cost of living. Whew, now let's move on to Tennessee...\n\n## Is Tennessee A Cheap State To Live In?\n\nIn short, Tennessee enjoys an especially low cost of living. According to a study conducted by the World Population Review, in 2021 Tennessee is the country's sixth cheapest state to live in. That's pretty standard for The Volunteer State, where living costs have historically landed it in the top ten for affordability.\n\n### Grocery costs\n\nTennessee's grocery bills are rated a 95 according to our cost of living calculator, which means that groceries tend to cost 5% less than the U.S. average. This might not seem like much, but five cents on the dollar adds up quickly when you're feeding a family. Tennessee and its surrounding region are home to robust agricultural production and food processing that efficiently provide affordable grocery options. This grocery discount is just another small factor that makes a big difference in the Tennessee cost of living.\n\n### Housing costs\n\n#### Cost of buying a home in Tennessee\n\nAs in any state, Tennessee housing values can vary dramatically based on the area where you're looking to buy. Still, as long as you aren't browsing in Nashville's swankiest neighborhoods, you can expect to pay well below the national average. Tennessee's median home value is around $165,000. That's around $65,000 less than the national average, and represents a huge cost of living advantage for the state. Even attractive urban areas offer affordable housing options. Chattanooga, for instance boasts a remarkably reasonable median home cost of only $150,100. Options, like these, offer big city living at small-town prices.\n\n#### Cost of renting a home in Tennessee\n\nThe Tennessee rental market is also quite accessible. Rent for all types of properties usually rests 20%-30% below the national average. That means a studio apartment throughout much of the state rents for around $600, while a three-bedroom house can be found for just over $1100. This varies by location and city, for instance, Nashville rent options are normally just above average. All things considered, though, in Tennessee you'll find some of the best median rent prices in the country.\n\n### Healthcare costs\n\nHealthcare costs in Tennessee aren't optimal in every location. Not every place has an ideal supply of doctors, and the population is prone to some indulgences that don't always lead to the highest overall health rankings. Despite these drawbacks, some of the most expensive areas actually have the most reasonable health-related costs. Davidson county, home to Nashville, boasts remarkably cheap health bills compared to the rest of the state. \n\n### Utility costs\n\nThe cost of utilities, across nearly all of Tennessee, are 4%-5% lower than the average in the United States. This is thanks largely to the awesome energy generation of the TVA and the state's abundance of freshwater. Services like these help provide for even the most rural, remote locations at a price that doesn't harm the overall cost of living.\n\n### Transportation costs\n\nGetting around Tennessee is a surprisingly easy proposition. Modest gas prices and shorter-than-average commutes will consistently keep money in your pockets. Tennesseeans spend less time in their cars on an annual basis than most other U.S. residents, which leaves more room in the budget for new arrivals to explore the rest of the state. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## How Much Are Taxes In Tennessee\n\n### Property taxes\n\nTennessee has no state property taxes, and leaves it up to local jurisdictions to determine and collect their own. Fortunately, most of these local governments keep tax rates modest. Urban areas have higher tax rates of around .820% of assessed value, while the state average is just .640%. Compared to the national average of 1.070%, these property tax thresholds are quite low, and represent huge long-term savings relative to other parts of the U.S.\n\n### Sales tax\n\nTennessee's sales taxes are higher than some other states, but that ensures that the state's millions of visitors are helping foot the bill for services that residents enjoy. On a state level, the tax on food is 5%, while most everything else includes a 7% sales tax. There's also an option for local governments to tack a little extra onto that rate. However, considering the tax breaks across the rest of the state's books, the sales tax is fairly reasonable.\n\n### State income tax\n\nThe rumors are true! Tennessee has no state income tax. That means you pay nothing to the state for the money you make.\n\n### Capital gains/pension tax\n\n[Tennessee does tax your gains on investments](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-when-selling-a-home-in-tennessee). So you'll have to pay back small percentages of your stock dividends and bond interest. However, there's no state pension tax, so retirees who call Tennessee home find that their dollars go a long way.\n\n## Is It Expensive To Live In Tennessee\n\nAccording to all these factors, Tennessee is simply one of the most budget-friendly states in the U.S. As long as you don't plan on living in the most luxurious of Nashville suburbs, your cost of living is exceedingly reasonable. Places like Chattanooga and Memphis offer some of the most manageable suburban real estate in the country. Then smaller but charming cities, like Clarksville and Johnson City, make living in Tennessee an even better bargain. But even if you do call Nashville home, you're paying to live in one of the most attractive, up-and-coming cities in the country. It's simply the kind of place where the cost of living is a little higher because everyone wants to live there.\n\nThe cost of living in Tennessee is especially impressive because the area provides such great value. Conveniently-located, low cost cities are dotted throughout the state, all offering distinctly different lifestyles and entertainment options. Combine that with some of the best cultural experiences and natural beauty that the United States has to offer, and Tennessee doesn't just provide limited cost of living, but high quality of life. Between the housing bargains, forgiving taxes (don't forget that income tax break), and feasible living expenses, there just aren't many places like it to call home. \n\n## How Does the Cost of Living in Tennessee Compare to the National Average?\n\nAs you might expect based on previous sections, living in Tennessee is one of the most budget-friendly decisions you can make in the entire United States. Rural areas, while never too far from a city, offer a cost of living that's sometimes 30%-40% below the national average. Even second-tier cities like Chattanooga are well below the national average according to our cost of living calculator. [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-nashville), for all its style and status as the most expensive place to live in the state, still comes in at just above the national average for cost of living. Basically, wherever you reside in Tennessee, you're getting a spectacular value compared to just about every other place in the country. \n\n### States with the highest cost of living\n\n#### Hawaii\n\nThe real estate and grocery prices on this remote island location are astronomical. Considering the state's lack of accessibility and space, this is no great surprise. \n\n#### California\n\nMedian home values are staggering, and high gas prices keep transportation expensive. This helps explain why Nashville has seen a steady flow of Californians making the move to Tennessee.\n\n#### New York\n\nYou've heard this story before. High taxes, a large population, and cutthroat competition for resources make the Big Apple an expensive bite.\n\n#### Oregon\n\nIronically enough, private land is limited in the Beaver State, which means housing expenses can be high. This, along with a bloated tax policy and upper-tier transportation costs, makes for an unpleasant cost of living threshold.\n\n#### Massachusetts\n\nAnother densely populated Northeastern state where people pay a lot of money for a little space.\n\n### States with the lowest cost of living\n\n#### Mississippi\n\nPlenty of ports, agriculture, and cheap housing make Mississippi an unbelievably attainable place to call home.\n\n#### Arkansas\n\nCosts like housing and taxes are negligible in Arkansas compared to other parts of the U.S.\n\n#### Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma's central location helps keep prices down, as it's never far from natural resources. This means it doesn't take much money to build houses or snag some food.\n\n#### Missouri\n\nHome to the cheapest gas in the country and everything else is quite reasonable as well.\n\n#### New Mexico\n\nNew Mexico is at the front of the cost of living pack in nearly every category but groceries.\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is where five-star service meets low commissions!

Tennessee’s top LGBT areas offer Southern hospitality with a little extra glitter thrown in.\n\nIf you’re looking for LGBT culture, events, businesses, and more, you’ll find some. Throughout the state in big cities, smaller towns, and everything in between, you will find a welcoming place to call “home” or looking to meet like-minded people in your area. We’ve put together a list of the 9 most LGBT-friendly places to live in Tennessee. So, prepare to get vibrant, be out and proud, and have fun in one of these Tennessee locales.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## How To Determine If A Neighborhood Is LGBT Friendly\n\nWhen you’re in an LGBT-friendly neighborhood, you feel the warm hug of welcomeness. However, identifying a gay-friendly locale from the outside may not be as easy. In order to create our list of the most friendly, inclusive, and open places for LGBT individuals to live, we looked at pride events, gay-friendly businesses, LGBT non-profits, and LGBT organizations. We even chatted with locals.\n\n## Nashville\n\nThere’s no need for [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville) to come out as gay-friendly. This hotbed of art and music has been a hub for queer communities in Tennessee for decades. While many people refer to Nashville as the “buckle of the Bible Belt,” others have renamed it “[A shining liberal buckle on the tired Bible Belt](https://queerintheworld.com/gay-nashville-tennessee-travel-guide/).” This is because Nashville has an extensive liberal and progressive population.\n\nWith more fun and culture than most new residents can experience in under a year, you likely won’t be surprised that Nashville offers many unique gay experiences such as Suzy Wong’s House of Yum and Cafe Coco.\n\nNashville even has its own gay publication, Out \u0026 About, which you will find at all the local libraries. Nashville also hosts an elaborate and exciting pride parade and pride festival each year. And Music City also has a wide array of smaller [gay pride events](https://www.nashvillepride.org/new-events) throughout the year. \n\nMany of the area’s gay and straight residents volunteer and support the many non-profits in the area that support struggling gay youth and other queer people in need of a helping hand. PFLAG, Nashville CARES, and Oasis are the most well-known in the area.\n\n### What neighborhoods in Nashville are the most gay-friendly?\n- [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville)\n- [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills)\n- [12 South](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/12-south)\n- [West End](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/hillsboro-west-end)\n- [The Nations](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-nations)\n- [Hillsboro Village](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/hillsboro-belmont)\n\n\n## Memphis\n\nMemphis is a haven for Tennessee's LGBT population. This expansive city embraces both art and its residents, no matter how they identify. And they’re ready to step up and help LBGT youth, trans people, and other LGBT people. In fact, Memphis has the [highest number of LGBT non-profits](https://www.causeiq.com/directory/lgbt-rights-organizations-list/tennessee-state/) in Tennessee. \n\nMemphis is home to many gay bars in and around its downtown center in the Midtown area. Here you will find a Wrangler’s-and-cowboy-boots aesthetic, but you don’t have to wear spurs to have fun. The Pumping Station and DRUS Bar are some of the most happening places for LGBT nightlife. \n\nLike Nashville, Memphis has a widely circulated LGBT publication, Focus Mid-South, which keeps the community up on the latest events and happenings. The Memphis Gaydar is also a fun way to stay apprised with gay news, events, and more in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nThis historic city has one of the most prominent LGBT community theater organizations, [Friends of George’s](https://www.friendsofgeorges.org/).  Memphis also hosts the [Mid-South Pride Festival](https://midsouthpride.org/), which always attracts a massive turnout.\n\n[OUTMemphis](https://www.outmemphis.org/) is an exceptionally effective and large non-profit that centers its energy and efforts on helping all LGBT people in the Memphis area. They are a resource for the community and cultural events along with health and wellness and preventing homelessness.\n\n## Knoxville\n\nKnoxville exclaims its inclusivity with the motto: Y’all Means ALL. And Knoxville came in at number eight for the gayest cities in American according to *[Advocate](https://www.advocate.com/travel/2012/01/09/gayest-cities-america-2012?pg=7#article-content)* in 2012. \n\nAs a university town, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Knoxville remains committed to pushing equality and investing in the arts while protecting the civil liberties of its LGBT residents. It’s not uncommon to stumble across a march downtown in support of LGBT rights or other forms of activism. If you’re in the area, you have to check out [Keep Knox Queer](https://www.facebook.com/groups/keepknoxqueer/) or one of the other [major gay pride events](https://knoxpride.com/) hosted in the city. In fact, Knoxville’s 2018 Pride Festival helped the city set the record for the largest Pride Fest in Tennessee.\n\nThis medium-sized city has a sizable queer population with businesses to boot. In fact, Knoxville rivals Memphis in its number of gay bars, despite being about half the size. The Edge and Club XYZ are two local favorites when it comes to letting your hair down and having a drink in a gay-friendly bar.\n\nOther highlights that make Knoxville a great place to be out and proud include that it was one of the first cities in the south and the first in Tennessee to have an LGBT liaison for the Knoxville Police Department and the Mayor’s administration. There are also many LGBT rights non-profit organizations in Knoxville, including Knox Pride. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Chattanooga\n\nWe let the cat out of the bag with this one. While many people drive through Chattanooga on their way from Atlanta to Nashville, few stop. And far fewer LGBT people stop. This may be because of the ominous crosses you’ll see as you travel I-24, but we are pleased to say that Chatanooga is a hidden gem when it comes to gay culture and acceptance.\n\nThroughout Chatanooga, you will find self-identified gay-friendly neighborhoods. The most notable of these is the North Shore district where diversity is queen, and neighbors are neighborly, no matter your color, creed, or identity.\n\nNot only does Chattanooga offer small-town charm, but it also has an abundant array of places to enjoy the arts and culture. For some nightlife, many local LGBT people head to Alan’s Gold Discotheque or Backstage Bar.\n\nWhat about those crosses? Yes, Chattanooga is part of the Bible Belt, but many churches are open and affirming of gay members in their congregations. [New Covenant Church](http://www.newcovenantchattanooga.com/) is one of the most popular among gay Christians.\n\nChattanooga has its own exciting and lively annual [Pride Parade](https://www.chattanoogapride.com/) and many other [Pride events](https://www.facebook.com/TennesseeValleyPride/) throughout the year. This city also has its own chapter of [PFLAG](https://pflag.org/chapter/pflag-chattanooga).\n\nIf you want to live in a gay-friendly city with unlimited outdoor activities, you cannot beat Chatanooga.\n\n## Johnson City\n\nTucked into the northeast corner of Tennessee, you will find Johnson City. This small town may only have about 65,000 residents, but it is the ninth biggest city in the state and one of the warmest when it comes to LGBT neighborliness. \n\nWhat makes this city such a gay-friendly anomaly for a small Southern town? Its gay-friendly atmosphere may be due to its four colleges and universities, or it may just be that residents of Johnson City just tend to embrace everyone with open arms. Either way, this quaint, quiet, and picturesque town is a great place to be out and proud.\n\nJohnson City just started hosting a Pride Fest, but their very first one attracted happy participants from all over. In fact, over 10,000 people showed up for the [inaugural Johnson City Pride Parade and Festival](https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/10000-celebrate-inaugural-tri-pride-festival-in-johnson-city/)–That’s one-sixth of the city’s population.\n\nAs for gay nightlife, the New Beginnings and The Crow Bar are two local favorites. And this lovely city has the [fifth largest population of LGBT people](https://heraldcourier.com/news/johnson-city-fifth-in-state-when-it-comes-to-same-sex-couples/article_93df4a8d-51d3-522a-858f-0d810f9b3570.html) in the state according to the 2010 census.\n\nAs for non-profits, you will find the [Pride Community Center of the Tri-Cities](http://pridetricities.com/), which continually increases the visibility of the gay community and advocates for gay rights. They also support gay youth in need and bring attention to gay-owned businesses.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a close-knit community away from the hustle and bustle, which also embraces LGBT people, it is difficult to beat Johnson City in Tennessee.\n\n## Jackson\n\nHalfway between Nashville and Memphis, you will find Jackson, Tennessee, a small city that is wholeheartedly committed to providing all residents with the best. Similar in size to Johnson City with just under 70,000 residents, Jackson has made large strides toward inclusivity. \n\n[Equality Jackson](https://equalityjacksontn.org/resources/) has been a driving force in increasing LGBT visibility. They also assist LGBT people in crisis, help connect LGBT people with gay-friendly churches, and organize events. [Out Jackson](https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/life/style/jackson-life/2017/05/05/lgbtq-launches-jackson/101288242/) is an organization that has encouraged LGBT people to be open about their identities to reduce the stigma and normalize being gay. \n\nAs far as community atmosphere, most people would describe living in Jackson as like living in Mayberry. This may scare some LGBT people given the idea that most small towns are not accepting of LGBT people. However, neighbors in Jackson welcome others with open arms, and much of the city has participated in the “I love Jackson and I support LGBTQ equality” campaign. The purpose of the campaign has been to break the stereotype that small towns are homophobic. And, so far, it’s been a huge success.\n\n## Gatlinburg \u0026 Pigeon Forge\n\nWhen it comes to the small resort towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, many queer folks feel quite welcome and content. Just a stone’s throw from Dollywood and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, these relaxed and hippie-like towns are known for prioritizing creating an inviting atmosphere for all. \n\nWhile you won’t find many gay nightclubs or bars in the area, you will find many gay-friendly accommodations and businesses galore. With events like [Gay Day at Dollywood](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/gay-day-at-dollywood-brings-red-shirts-to-smoky-mtns/), we anticipate more and more visibility for LGBT people in the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area.\n\nDolly Parton plays a major role in the Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg communities. She donated quite a bit of money for relief after the Gatlinburg Fires, and because Dollywood has been a major contributor to the local economy most locals pay her a lot of respect. As a major advocate for equality in Tennesee and gay icon, Dolly Parton’s attitude has spread throughout these small towns. And most residents offer a warm welcome to gay people.\n\n## Brentwood \u0026 Franklin\n\n[Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) and [Brentwood, Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood) are located just south of Nashville. And just as South Nashville bleeds into Brentwood, so do the forward-thinking and LGBT-positive attitudes. While these cities do not have quite as large of a network of gay organizations, they do have residents with positive attitudes and many places of worship that are happy to invite LGBT people into their congregations. \n\nFranklin does host its own [Pride Fest](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2020/01/28/franklin-tn-pride-2020-franklin-theatre/4598087002/) and has its own [PFLAG organization](https://www.facebook.com/PFLAGFranklinTN/). Many gay residents of the area drive north to Nashville for fun nights out at bars such as [Trax](https://www.facebook.com/traxnashville). They also join Nashville LGBT organizations to promote and expand visibility and equality throughout the Middle Tennessee region.\n\n## Clarksville\n\nAbout an hour northwest of Nashville, you will find the fifth biggest city in Tennessee, [Clarksville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/clarksville). This small city is home to Austin Peay State University and borders Fort Campbell. These institutions can feel like opposing forces when it comes to acceptance, at times. And the city still seems to be in flux when it comes to progressive attitudes regarding LGBT rights. However, Clarksville is headed in the right direction.\n\nClarksville has its own [Pride Fest](https://clarksvillenow.com/local/new-lgbt-group-forms-to-support-equality-local-pride-march/) and an active group of advocates that run [Equality Clarksville](https://www.facebook.com/equalityclarksville/). As far as nightlife, many gay Clarksville residents make the trek to Nashville where there are plenty of gay bars to choose from.\n\nIn response to a recent [national survey](https://clarksvillenow.com/local/clarksville-dinged-on-lgbtq-equality-in-new-report-updates-discrimination-policy/) that rated cities based on their LGBTQ equality, Clarksville has recommitted energy and funds to improve the city for queer people. Community leaders have been vocal about their support of the Clarksville LGBT community and want their LGBTQ neighbors to feel welcome.\n\n## Our Final Thoughts\n\nLGBT communities offer welcoming, open, often artistic settings for LGBT families, young professionals, couples, and individuals.

You may be surprised which cities rank as the wealthiest.\n\n[**PRO TIP: Has living in Tennessee been on your mind? Check out our local guide to living in The Volunteer State.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Methodology\n\nHow did we decide which cities in Tennessee ranked as the richest? We used the most recent U.S. census data to determine Tennessee cities’ median household income. Since the U.S. Census lumps all residents with incomes over $250,000 per year, we also factored in the average home price, unemployment rate, highest education attained, and poverty rate. In addition to looking at income, home price, and other factors, we did account for population.\n\n## City 10: Farragut\n\n- **Median household income: $128,809**\n- **Median property value: $656,002**\n\nFarragut is nestled between Knoxville and Oak Ridge in Eastern Tennessee. This suburban city is grounded in family, outdoor living, and science. Why science? Many of the prestigious scientists that work at Oak Ridge National Lab reside in Farragut. This lovely town allows families to enjoy the perks of Knoxville’s infrastructure and culture and the University of Tennessee’s events and amenities.

This beautiful suburb is one of the best places to call “home” in the Volunteer State. Despite being a quick drive to all the fun of Memphis, Germantown feels like a completely different country. In fact, it feels like a country with sizable yards, friendly neighbors, and plenty of places to watch the lightning bugs flutter about. This wealthy city has a wealth of parks, natural areas, and historic sights. Germantown also features a wide variety of home styles, including stately mansions, historic German-inspired architecture, and more.\n\n## City 7: Lookout Mountain\n\n- **Median household income: $135,114**\n- **Median property value: $534,500**\n\nIt’s difficult to find a better view than Lookout Mountain in all of Tennessee.

And while this city in [Williamson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-williamson-county-tennessee) is anything but haughty, it does have a population that out-earns the majority of the state. \n\nNolensville continues to grow as Nashville residents move south to escape the city. Since the 2010 census, [Nolensville’s population has increased by 107%](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/nolensville-tn-population), and it’s easy to understand why.

Brentwood is a medium-sized city that sees more and more growth every year. Despite being one of the wealthiest cities in Tennessee, Brentwood residents are down to Earth.

It’s said that many country stars and other celebrities live in and around the hills surrounding the scenic park.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the latest listings in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/oak-hill)**\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## City 2: Belle Meade\n\n- **Median household income: $220,417**\n- **Median property value: $860,000**\n\n[Belle Meade](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-belle-meade-in-nashville) exemplifies southern charm, hospitality, and grandiosity. With a long history of wealth, it’s no surprise that this corner of Nashville is often considered Nashville’s coin purse. Before Belle Meade became home to 2,400 residents, it was home to John Harding, a southern plantation owner who invited the elite of the South to enjoy his “Belle Meade” or “beautiful meadow.” This city still has expansive yards, lush spaces, and picturesque venues that people travel from near and far to see and experience.\n\n**[PRO TIP: These listings in Belle Meade will blow you away](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/belle-meade)**\n\n## City 1: Forest Hills\n\n- **Median household income: $299,069**\n- **Median property value: $853,000**\n\n[Forest Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-forest-hills-in-nashville) is where serenity meets luxury.

Weather is an enormous factor in deciding your next place to call home. Weather affects our jobs, commutes, physical energy, and overall mood. Take a glance below at some frequently asked questions about the weather to discover if [living in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) could be right for you!\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Kind Of Climate Should Be Expected?\n\nA major reason Tennessee visitors become locals is that they enjoy the moderate climate. With four distinct seasons, Tennessee is particularly favorable to those who prefer variety in the weather throughout the year. Each season showcases the unique beauty of this state. Spring is filled with the blooming vibrancy of wildflowers, fall’s gorgeous foliage lasts well into November, winters are mild while occasionally bringing flurries, and summer brings a plethora of outdoor activities with its heatwave. \n\nFor those who balk at extremes, Tennessee has neither blistering summers nor frigid winters. Yearly average temperatures come in at [40 degrees for winters and around 83 degrees during summers](https://www.tnvacation.com/retire-tennessee/living-in-tn). While the climate may still be too humid for some, especially for folks from the northern regions, the heat of most summer days is quite manageable - plus, Tennessee’s multitude of rivers, lakes, and waterfalls provides plenty of recreational opportunities to cool off!\n\n## Dry Or Wet?\n\nTennessee averages about [53 inches of rainfall per year](https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/state/tennessee), considered an [above-average](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-state-precipitation.php) number in the United States. However, this number doesn’t necessarily indicate consistently drab and dreary days - in fact, Tennessee has an average of [207 sunny days](https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/state/tennessee), above the nation’s average of 205. This state’s sudden downpours and frequent spring/summer thunderstorms are the contributors to this higher-than-average precipitation. Otherwise, Tennessee’s weather is mostly [partly cloudy to sunny](https://weatherspark.com/y/14687/Average-Weather-in-Nashville-Tennessee-United-States-Year-Round) year-round. Spring brings the most showers, with May ranking as the state’s [wettest month](https://www.tripsavvy.com/nashville-weather-averages-2477627). As fall rolls around, rainfall becomes less frequent as Tennessee enters the dry season.\n\n[**PRO TIP: Narrow your home search by checking out our local guide to living in Tennessee.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)\n\n## Any Chance Of A White Christmas?\n\nProbably not - Tennessee is ranked as one of the [least snowy states](https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/state/tennessee) and averages about [5 inches of snow per year](https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/state/tennessee). While Tennessee winters can be quite cold - warm coats are definitely a must - frozen precipitation is unlikely and most winters are fairly mild. Cold seasons are shorter here, lasting for about [3 months](https://weatherspark.com/y/14687/Average-Weather-in-Nashville-Tennessee-United-States-Year-Round) out of the year, with January ranked as the coldest month. Rain is the most likely form of precipitation in winter, as the temperature usually hovers in the low 40s. When the temperature does drop below freezing, ice and sleet are much more common than snow. Because Tennessee isn’t used to much icy precipitation in most regions, expect road closures, school delays, and hazardous sidewalk conditions. However, most northerners won’t bat an eye!\n\nStill longing for a white Christmas? Don’t rule the possibility out! Snow is more frequent in Tennessee’s northern, mountainous regions. Those who prefer cooler weather should head towards those areas. Additionally, Nashville itself had a 2020 Christmas Eve snowfall, so anything is certainly possible.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Are Tornadoes A Concern?\n\nWhile not located in the infamous Tornado Alley, Tennessee still often sees tornadoes, most commonly in the [middle and western regions](https://www.tennessean.com/story/weather/2021/06/17/tornadoes-tennessee-heres-what-know-understand-and-remember/5186539001/) where the land is flatter and more exposed. Ranked [#9 in the nation](https://www.tennessean.com/story/weather/2021/06/17/tornadoes-tennessee-heres-what-know-understand-and-remember/5186539001/) for tornado frequency, Tennessee’s tornadoes most commonly occur in springtime when the temperature fluctuates. While the threat of tornadoes can be unsettling (and rightly so), Tennessee takes [numerous steps](https://www.tn.gov/aging/learn-about/disaster-preparedness/severe-storms.html) to ensure its residents remain safe, prepared, and informed. Because of the state’s preparedness and planning, most locals feel secure from these storms.\n\n## I’m Visiting - What Should I Bring To Prepare For The Weather?\n\nSummer will be humid and hot - bring cool, airy clothing as well as plenty of sunscreen and water. Be sure to pack a swimsuit to enjoy all of Tennessee's water activities! The weather can change quickly in the summer, so be prepared for short downpours that last about 20 minutes. Since spring is the wettest season in Tennessee, an umbrella, rain boots, and a rain jacket are definitely advisable. While the weather warms up quickly in springtime, nights can be quite chilly, so pack a sweater or jacket.\n\nFall is one of Tennessee's most beautiful seasons. Temperatures are comfortable and the weather is very sunny. Just bring some layers for the cooler evenings - no need to worry about much rain! Winter months, while lacking snow most of the time, will still be cold. Warm coats (and sometimes scarves and hats) are must-bring items.\n\nTennessee weather can be unpredictable! Locals often joke that if you’re not fond of the weather on a given day, it will probably change tomorrow. Statistics seem to agree, as Tennessee scores a [70 out of 100](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-city-has-the-most-unpredictable-weather/) on FiveThirtyEight’s chart ranking the nation’s most unpredictable cities for weather.\n\n## What’s The Final Verdict?\n\nMost locals really enjoy Tennessee's climate. In fact, this state is rated [7.3 out of 10](https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/state/tennessee) on BestPlaces Comfort Index, indicating favorable reviews from residents and a higher degree of satisfaction than most states in the nation. This beautiful state has something to offer for everyone and its moderate climate ensures that most residents are pleased year-round. Could Tennessee be your next home?

Tennessee is home to a wealth of natural beauty. This includes the Great Smoky Mountains, lakes, rivers, and rolling hillsides. There are bustling cities, but also plenty of rural areas for you to spread out. You will be surprised by the value The Volunteer State provides.\n\nThe cost of building a home in Tennessee varies. Cities like Nashville are booming, but there are plenty of places where you can catch a deal. We’ll break down the construction costs of building a new construction home in Tennessee.\n\n## What’s The Average Cost To Build A House By Square Foot In Tennessee?\n\nThe average cost to build a house in Tennessee is [$130.97 per square foot](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-build-a-house/). To put that in perspective, the average price of a 2,000-square-foot home in Tennessee is [$261,940](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-build-a-house/). This estimate is probably on the low-end for cities in Tennessee, however.\n\n## Is Building A House In Tennessee More Expensive Than In Other States?\n\nTennessee has comparable home prices to neighboring states like Alabama ([$133.81/ sq ft](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-build-a-house/)) and Georgia ([$136.93/ sq ft](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-build-a-house/)).\n\nBut you really start to see the savings in Tennessee when you compare it to higher cost of living states like California ($202.72/ sq ft), New Jersey ($188.45/ sq ft), and New York ($180.09/ sq ft). So if you’re looking to relocate, Tennessee might be the right fit.\n\n![Ariel image of a rural town in Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_2_053d3df076_629f7b0c4d.png)\n\n### Is land cheaper in Tennessee?\n\nThe average cost of an acre of land in Tennessee is [$14,400](https://netar.us/market-pulse-february-23-2021/). But some residential lots in high-cost areas like Nashville can go for much more than this. \n\nIf you compare that to California at around [$39K](https://www.flyhomes.com/blog/how-much-is-an-acre-of-land/), you can see how costs can add up in Tennessee.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## How Do Different Cities Compare In Price When Building A House In Tennessee?\n\nNot all cities cost the same in Tennessee. Let’s break down the costs of the major cities in Tennessee. \n\n### Nashville\n\n![Ariel image of downtown Nashville, Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_3_4bffd5c1b6_54dd042490.png)\n\nNashville and its suburbs are the priciest areas in the state. The average cost per square foot is $193.24 in most areas. Tremendous growth brings demand. So you are likely to pay more for a new house when building in Nashville.\n\nBut the tradeoff may be worth it. Nashville has a [lower cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-nashville) compared to coastal cities, and the vibrant culture is unparalleled compared to other parts of the state. There are also many suburbs that are [great places to raise a family](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families) such as Brentwood, Franklin, or Mt. Juliet.\n\n### Memphis\n\n![Image of Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_4_a3c9ab9ee4_4e6ac40c77.png)\n\nMemphis is the cheapest major city in the state per square foot, clocking in at $108.50. Memphis is also a large city with many amenities like an international airport, NBA team, and great BBQ. So Memphis is a good option for those looking for a deal while also needing access to a major city.\n\n### Chattanooga\n\n![Ariel image of downtown Chattanooga, Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_5_444f359448_1d2a880458.png)\n\nChattanooga has been experiencing a significant spike in prices lately at $112.07 per square foot on average. This smaller city brings a lot to the table. Chattanooga is an outdoor town with many opportunities to be in the mountains or water. Its quirky culture tilts a little hippie, and people love the area for its smaller-scale urban feel.\n\n### Knoxville\n\n![Image of Knoxville, Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_6_be7e074d0b_d0d5235f03.png)\n\nKnoxville is another option for those looking for smaller cities in Tennessee. On average, a new construction home in Knoxville costs $109.97 per square foot. With the Smoky Mountains in your backyard and many of the amenities of living in a large college town, you’re bound to find a lot to do. You also get the added benefit of one of the lowest costs of living in the state.\n\n## Cost Concerns For Building A House In Tennessee\n\nHere are some significant areas where you will run into cost issues while building a new home in Tennessee. \n\n### Materials\n\nMaterials typically comprise 30- 50% of the overall cost of a residential new construction project. But with national supply chain issues, the material cost can change and likely increase before a new home is completed. Over the last few years, the cost of lumber has skyrocketed, affecting the bottom line of [homebuilders in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-high-production-home-builders-in-tennessee). Most recently, the construction industry has been experiencing a [concrete shortage](https://www.procontractorsupplyinc.com/why-is-there-a-concrete-shortage-in-the-us/). These global supply chain issues trickle down and affect your home’s cost and construction timeline. So not only do you pay more for building materials, but you also may have to pay for delays and added labor costs. \n\nYour home construction cost can also go up if your choose high-end finishes. Luxury homes require higher-priced materials and specialized subcontractors to install these complicated finishes.\n\n### Labor\n\n![Image of a construction worker framing the roof of a house](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_7_3cd6ecfee7_e2d6e9ffe8.png)\n\nThe average cost of a construction worker in Tennessee is between [$15- $18 per hour](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Construction-Worker-Salary-per-Hour). While this cost is lower than in other parts of the country, it is still costly. It’s crucial to hire a reputable builder and general contractor who can manage labor costs. You may not always get a say in material price increases, but an experienced builder will know how to use labor efficiently so that these costs do not skyrocket. \n\nFelix can assist in your selection of a quality builder. We vet hundreds of builders in local markets to find the right one for you.\n\n### Other factors\n\nThe type of new construction home that you choose can have a major impact on your total cost. Custom homes are by far the most expensive. The infinite choices in materials, unstandardized construction process, and potential lot issues can add up quickly. \n\nSome more cost-friendly options are semi-custom and [spec houses](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/spec-house-meaning). Building a new house from predetermined plans that you get to customize is a great compromise. You can choose the elements that make your home unique without breaking the bank.\n\n## What’s The Cost Breakdown Of Building A House In Tennessee?\n\nWe pulled data from the [National Home Builders Association](https://www.nahb.org/) to give you an idea of where costs come from when building a house. This section will give you an idea of where prices start to add up for your cost estimates.\n\n### Lot\n\nThe average cost for a finished lot is [$89,540](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). A finished lot refers to one that is ready for construction and has all utility systems installed. You often find finished lots in subdivisions, and you purchase lots from a builder. \n\nThe other option is to purchase a plot of land that isn’t finished. While this option has a smaller initial price tag, you will have to get the site ready yourself. Getting a site ready could cost a significant amount if the lot needs to be cleared of trees and graded. This could result in a significant cost, and you could hit unknown delays. So do your homework carefully before purchasing unprepared land.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Plans, permits, and other fees\n\nA lot of money goes into your house before you even start construction. The average cost of plans, permits, and other fees totals around [$18K](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). Let’s break down the average costs for these fees:\n\n- The national average for building permits and inspections is around [$5,086](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). But in Tennessee, the price is just under [$2,000](https://www.tn.gov/commerce/fire/residential-permits/fire-residential-building-permit-fees.html). So you will save a little with permitting and inspections in Tennessee. But this is essential to ensure you meet the proper building codes.\n- Many communities will charge an impact fee of about [$3,800](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx) to pay for new infrastructure. \n- If you’re using an architect for a truly custom home, you can expect to pay, on average, [$4,335](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). Your house plans include your floor plans which will determine the best layout for your square footage. So this is money well-spent if you’re not using the builder’s plans.\n\n\n### Site work and foundation\n\n![Image of a slab foundation for a new construction house](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_8_b5cb30a5ac_eff0c6c717.png)\n\nThe average cost of site work and a foundation is [$34,850](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). This is arguably one of the most critical parts of your home’s construction. Your house will require heavy-duty machines to perform excavation and professionals to ready the land for construction. You also never know what’s under the surface until you start digging. Your lot may require additional drainage or a retaining wall if the topography calls for this. \n\nThis is also when water, electricity, and sewer get set up. Your lot may require a septic tank if you are far from sewer lines. Check with your local government. \n\nIf you need to install a septic system, you will need to get a percolation test or perc test. A perc test will determine the soil absorption rate and you will receive a septic permit that will show how many bedrooms your septic system can accommodate. If you know your property will require septic, it’s best to perform the perc test before purchasing the land.\n\nThen comes the foundation. Some homes have concrete slabs, while others have a crawlspace foundation. Your builder will also charge a premium for installing a basement as well.\n\n### Framing\n\nWhen builders are [framing your house](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-frame-a-house), they are essentially building the skeleton. The average cost of framing is [$51,589](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). Lumber costs are high right now, and your house requires a lot of lumber to create the frame. You are likely to pay more if your home’s plans require trusses in the roof (triangular roof build) or if you use metal or steel in your framing.\n\n### Exterior finishes\n\nThe exterior finish includes the materials that cover the walls. This includes brick, stone, and siding. This cost will fluctuate based on material choice. The cost also includes things like windows and doors. Consider more premium materials for energy efficiency because the savings can pay off in the long run. \n\nThe average cost for exterior finishes clocks in at [$41,690](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx).\n\n### Major systems\n\nThe major systems of a new construction home include plumbing, electrical, and HVAC. This does not include fixtures– those get factored into interior costs. But these are the systems inside your walls that make everything work in your home. You can expect to pay around [$44,000](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx) for this portion of construction.\n\n### Interior finishes\n\n![Image of a construction worker installing insulation in a house](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_9_3b235e73e3_49df584a1a.png)\n\nInterior finishes can add up in a new build. That’s because this category encompasses a wide range of quality and materials. There are also a lot of variabilities. You can upgrade many different parts of your interior, affecting cost. Here are the average prices for major interior finishes according to the [National Association of Home Builders](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx):\n\n- Insulation: $5,184\n- Drywall: $10,634\n- Interior trims, doors, and mirrors: $10,605\n- Painting: $8,254\n- Lighting: $3,437\n- Cabinets, countertops: $13,540\n- Appliances: $4,710\n- Flooring: $11,998\n- Plumbing fixtures: $4,108\n- Fireplace: $1,867\n- Other: $923\n\n\nThis totals to $75,259 for interior finishes or about 25% of your new construction budget. \n\n### Final steps\n\nThe final steps of building your house include landscaping, outdoor structures (like decks, patios, and porches), driveway, and general cleanup. This will cost around [$20,000](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/8F04D7F6EAA34DBF8867D7C3385D2977.ashx). \n\nDon’t forget that besides building a house, additional fees get added in the form of closing costs. This includes lender fees if you’re using a loan, title insurance, and HOA fees if your home is located in a community managed by a homeowners association. We recommend you speak with an experienced Realtor to determine your closing costs.\n\n## Can You Afford A New Constructing A Home In Tennessee?\n\nThe best part of building a house is that there can be some wiggle room with the budget. For example, you may decide to upgrade certain features while leaving others standard. There are ways to make decisions that can help you afford a new construction home in Tennessee.\n\n### Make a budget\n\nWe’ve provided you with the details on typical costs for a new build in Tennessee. These costs are just averages, but they will give you an idea of where to start.\n\nWhen creating a budget, you need to work backward. Calculate your typical expenses. Look at what you are paying in monthly housing costs. Can you afford to pay more, less, or the same? From there, you know what your typical mortgage costs should be each month.\n\n### Consider your existing house (if you have one)\n\n![Image of a man and woman packing items into a moving box.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_much_does_it_cost_to_build_a_house_in_tennessee_10_21906c7f52_b4d08c0e25.png)\n\nIf you have an existing house, what will be the expected proceeds from selling this home? You can use these proceeds as a down payment on your new build. When will you sell your home? Do you need the money to get your build going? Consider these questions as you move forward. At Felix, we have a lot of experience with new construction homes and can be a great resource if you have questions about the process.\n\n### Pick a location\n\nJust because a lot is for sale doesn’t mean you can build on it. Many people will opt for a subdivision because of the ease of building, and the costs are more manageable. If you’re wishing to purchase land in a rural area, make sure to conduct the proper soil test and look into the permits that may be required. Narrow down the location based on your lifestyle, commute, and price.\n\n### Find the right builder\n\nLook at builders who are working in your preferred location. Take the time to talk with them about your budget and the options they have to make sure they are a good fit. \n\nIf you’re especially budget-conscious, take the time to do your homework on the builder about their ability to stay on budget. Talk to recent customers and read online reviews or ask an experienced Realtor about the builder’s reputation. It’s key that you choose the right builder that knows how to give you an accurate quote and stick to it. \n\n### Consider the size and type of house\n\nMany costs are multiplied as your house gets bigger. Choose a type of house that is more cost-efficient. For example, one-story homes are more affordable. \n\nThe beauty of building a new house is that you have control over the decision-making process. So the decisions you make in the planning stages can add up big when you look at the final price.\n\n## Felix Helps You Manage Your New Build\n\nThe best way to stay on budget with your own home is to do your research before you even choose a builder. \n\nFelix will guide you in your journey and answer any questions that come up along the way.

This rebate provides significant savings to home buyers, challenging the traditional 6% commission structure. We leverage technology to offer lower commission fees, and make the case that the traditional 3% buyer’s agent commission is outdated. While we acknowledge the value of professional guidance in the home buying process, we encourage homebuyers to negotiate commission rates and take advantage of rebates to save on the largest investment most people will make.\n\n## Does Felix Homes Offer A Buyer Rebate In Georgia?\n\nIn short, yes, Felix Homes is proud to offer a home buyer rebate in Georgia! The exact amount of the rebate is dependent on the commission the seller is offering a buyer’s agent. \n\nFor example, let’s say that the seller is offering a 3% commission to the buyer’s agent. In this scenario, we would provide our client with a rebate equal to 1% of the purchase price. On the other hand, if the seller is offering a 2.5% commission to the buyer’s agent, then the buyer rebate would be 0.5% of the purchase price. \n\nThis buyer rebate – or as we call it, our Buyer Savings Program, is eligible to clients who have toured 14 homes or less with us. Once we have shown the client 15 homes, they are no longer eligible for a commission rebate.\n\n## What Is A Buyer Agent Commission?\n\nA buyer’s agent commission is the amount of compensation an agent receives for representing the buyer in a transaction. This amount has historically been 3% of the sales price. In most cases, the buyer’s agent is only entitled to a commission if the transaction closes. \n\nIn Georgia, the buyer agent commission is typically 2.5% - 3% of the sales price. Considering how the internet has allowed homebuyers to do much of the home searching themselves, the 3% commission seems drastically inflated, right?\n\n## Who Pays The Buyer Agent Commission?\n\nAny rational person would suggest that the seller would pay for the listing agent commission, and the buyer pays the buyer agent commission. This is a big misconception. Historically, the home seller is responsible for paying the agent commission for both the buyer and seller!\n\nOn average, this is a total of 6% of the purchase price in commission fees the seller ends up paying. The buyer's agent gets a 3% fee, and the listing agent would get a 3% fee. On a $700,000 home, that is $42,000 in realtor commission fees. That's a lot of money by any standards.\n\nJust because the buyer does not have to pay out of pocket to use the services of a buyer's agent doesn't mean it is free. A simple economics course would teach you that the buyer's agent commission is factored into the sales price. This is why so many buyers attempt to bypass the services of an agent to get a better price. Luckily, with a home buyer rebate, buyers can have their cake and eat it too by both saving money thanks to the commission rebate and also benefitting from the experience of a licensed agent.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is A Home Buyer Rebate?\n\nA home buyer rebate is when a buyer's agent gives their client back a portion of their commission they receive from the seller. Think of a commission rebate like cash back on a credit card. For instance, if a buyer's agent collected a 3% commission, or $21,000, they may elect to keep $14,000 of that commission and give their client a commission rebate of $7,000. \n\nA Realtor may decide to do this as a token of appreciation, a simple thank you, or as a way to get more clients! Commission rebates allow agents to compete for a buyer's business, not just on the level of service they provide but also the price they charge for that service. It's a win-win!\n\nThe concept of a buyer's commission rebate has become increasingly popular in recent years as buyers understand that they take on more of the legwork in the home search process. Buyers also understand that as home prices continue to appreciate, a 3% commission on a $100,000 home in 1980 is a lot less than a 3% commission on a $700,000 home today.\n\n## What Value Does A Buyer Agent Offer?\n\nAs unconventional as this may sound, the reality is, when it comes to being a real estate agent, a buyer's agent's job has drastically changed since the adoption of the internet.\n\n### What Did A Buyer's Agent Do Before The Internet?\n\nRewind the clock 15 or 20 years, and yes, these agents had their hands full discovering new inventory and manually coordinating when to physically tour homes. They would literally carry around a big binder filled with properties listed for sale. Nothing was online so if a home buyer wanted to see what inventory was available, they would first call their Realtor who would manually look through their binder and pick a few properties that met the buyer's needs.\n\nIf the buyer was then interested in making an offer on the property, doing a [comparable market analysis](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/comparative-market-analysis) wasn't as easy as it is today. Their agent would have to seek out all of the recent comps in their binder to manually compute their opinion of the [home's value](https://www.felixhomes.com/how-much-is-my-house-worth). These old-school agents didn't even have electronic signature software so every time a document needed to be signed by their client, they had to hop in their car and drive over to their client. All this time-consuming work meant that buyer agent commission rebates were never brought up until the advent of technology caused a huge shift in the industry.\n\n### How Did Technology Make The Job Of A Buyer Agent More Efficient?\n\nIn today's technological age, so much of these manual buyer agent tasks can be accomplished with the click of a mouse, or simply by scrolling on your phone. The internet and apps allow the home buyer to do most of the legwork! Buyers are able to preselect their 'requirements', and the [home-search website](https://www.felixhomes.com/feed) will automatically show them homes in their desired area that meet these requirements.\n\nIf you want 4 bedrooms, there's a filter for that. If you need a two-car garage, there is a filter for that too. All you need to do is ask your Realtor to unlock the front door so you can see if the pictures live up to the hype! If you're interested in making an offer on a home, your agent can easily do a comparable market analysis to determine what a fair price for the home should be. There is no longer the need to manually compute these critical numbers! **No wonder buyers are increasingly asking their agent for a rebate.**\n\n## Should You Use A Buyer Agent Or Represent Yourself?\n\nUsing a buyer’s agent is a valuable asset and we encourage you to work with one. After all, purchasing a home may be the largest investment you make. \n\nIt's a good idea to have a professional in your corner to help answer any of the questions you may have and help you negotiate the purchase. \n\nBut the reality is, in today's technology-driven world, buyer's agents are just not worth 3% of the final sales price. This is why many folks are starting to ask for a home buyer rebate from real estate agents.\n\n## Is It Legal For Real Estate Agents To Give Part Of Their Commission To Buyers In Georgia?\n\nIn the vast majority of the country, currently 40 of the 50 states, rebates are legal meaning agents are able to give any amount of their commission back to their clients. And yes, buyer rebates are perfectly legal in Georgia!\n\nThis unique business model can save home buyers thousands. Many buyers ask for a commission rebate as they realize there isn't a great deal of work that goes into representing them in this modern era. They also understand that the job of a buyer's agent has gotten more efficient through technology and the internet.\n\n## **What States Do Not Allow A Buyer Agent Rebate?**\n\nAs crazy as this sounds, there are still 10 states where it is illegal for an agent to give their client a commission rebate. \n\n- Alaska\n- Alabama\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Louisiana\n- Missouri\n- Mississippi\n- Oklahoma\n- Oregon\n- Tennessee\n\n![Infographic showing the states where a buyer agent commission rebate is legal.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Buyer_Commission_Reabte_Infographic_3b96ebfe26.svg)\n\nAlthough it's not legal for an agent to give part of their commission to the buyer in these 10 states, the commission rate can still be negotiated. There is no law mandating that the buyer's agent must take 3% of the purchase price as their commission. \n\n## How Can Felix Homes Help?\n\nFelix Homes is a [low-commission real estate brokerage](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/low-commission-real-estate-agents-nashville). We work with both [buyers](https://www.felixhomes.com/buy) and [sellers](https://www.felixhomes.com/sell) and help keep more profit in your pocket on each real estate transaction.\n\nNot only do we charge a lower commission on the buy side, we charge a flat [1.5% commission fee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/one-and-a-half-percent-commission-realtor-nashville) when we sell a home for our clients. On average, we help our clients save $12,375 when they choose to list their home with Felix. Our clients are able to save on commissions and use that cash for other important expenses such as a home renovation, family vacation, or downpayment on their dream home!\n\n## How Do We Charge Lower Commission Fees?\n\nThis is such a common question, and we love answering it! The fact of the matter is, we believe technology changed the real estate industry, but traditional Realtors are holding onto a higher commission fee for obvious reasons. Many years ago, paying a 6% commission fee may have been appropriate, but in today's world with all the real estate apps, online photos, home search websites, and virtual tours, that fee is no longer needed.\n\nIn addition, the average home price has skyrocketed. Commissions on a $700,000 are a lot more than what they would be on a $100,000 home. The 6% commission rate has stayed relatively unchanged, but all the variables that make up the rate (effort and price) have changed!\n\n## Our Final Thoughts On Buyer Rebates\n\nIn wrapping up our discussion on buyer agent commission rebates, it's clear that the landscape of real estate transactions is evolving, with technology at the forefront of this change. Felix Homes stands committed to adapting to these changes, offering buyer rebates as a testament to our belief in fair and transparent pricing. \n\nWe understand the significance of purchasing a home and strive to make this process as beneficial as possible for our clients. Our approach is rooted in the value we see in every home buyer's journey — empowering them with savings that extend beyond the transaction. In a market where every dollar counts, Felix Homes is proud to lead the charge in offering a financially savvy pathway to home ownership, ensuring our clients don't just find their dream home but also retain more of their hard-earned money in the process.","title":"Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Georgia","published_at":"2024-03-20T14:30:08.392Z","createdAt":"2024-03-20T01:40:34.609Z","updatedAt":"2024-12-17T23:24:07.929Z","__v":0,"image":{"_id":"6602f2955a839900164e78df","name":"Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Georgia.png","alternativeText":"Image of a piggy bank next to a model of a house.","caption":"","hash":"Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":4767.86,"width":5760,"height":3772,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9.png","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Georgia.png","hash":"thumbnail_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":238,"height":156,"size":106.89,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9.png"},"large":{"name":"large_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Georgia.png","hash":"large_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":1000,"height":655,"size":1430.9,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/large_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Georgia.png","hash":"medium_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":491,"size":868.51,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Georgia.png","hash":"small_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":327,"size":415.3,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/small_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Georgia_335beaedf9.png"}},"provider":"aws-s3","related":["65fa3e92837da30016afd415"],"createdAt":"2024-03-26T16:06:45.414Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-26T16:06:55.690Z","__v":0,"id":"6602f2955a839900164e78df"},"author":"Felix Homes","description":"Felix Homes offers a buyer's agent commission rebate in Georgia.

(*See chart below*).\n\n![July - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_2_9137f427a5.png)\n\nThis chart can be viewed as a \"snapshot\" of each month, but what if we look at the bigger picture and analyze the number of new listings added since January? \n\nCurrently, we're on pace to match the number of new listings that were added to the market in 2022. Assuming this pace will keep up through December, it will put us at a total of just under 14,400 listings added for the year. (*See chart below*).\n\n![July - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_3_3cc694593d.png)\n\nTotal inventory starts to account for the demand side of the equation since it includes closed listings as well as stale listings that carry over each month.\n\nThis is where things start to look ugly!\n\nWe've already determined that the number of new listings added to the market each month is on pace to match 2022. But, listings are not being taken off the market at the same pace, causing total inventory to climb. \n\nAt the end of July, there were **just under 3,500 listings on the market compared to around 3,000** by this time in 2022. (*See chart below*).\n\n![July - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_4_38b747301e.png)\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nThe issue in the equation is a lack of demand. This is further supported by the collapse in the number of closings in 2024. \n\nJuly 2024 saw just 649 homes close in Davidson County – a **staggering 24% fewer** closings than in July 2022 and just under 14% fewer closings than in 2023.\n\n![July - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_5_4470bac531.png)\n\nThe aggregate picture isn't looking too much better. Keep in mind that **supply is at a 2022 level but demand is nowhere close**. I estimate we'll end the year with under 8,000 closings in 2024 compared to nearly 10,000 closings in 2022.\n\n![July - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_6_966929612b.png)\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nSo, we've got a case of increasing supply and decreasing demand. In last month's market update, we spoke at length about the \"months of supply\" – a metric used in real estate to measure the balance between supply and demand.\n\nThis metric, while seasonal, was keeping pace with the 2023 numbers. For example, in May 2023, the months of supply was 2.59 – only a smidge lower than May 2024 at 3.10.\n\nBut, **in June 2024, months of supply spiked**. June has historically welcomed a low \"months of supply,\"  so seeing such a large increase was a shock!\n\n![July - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_7_c7fa03468b.png)\n\nIf we thought June was ugly, then we weren't prepared for what we were going to see in **July – months of supply hit 4.61** (*See chart above*)! \n\nThe only times it's been higher in the past 5 years were January 2023 (4.95), November 2023 (4.67), and January 2024 (4.84)...but that's not surprising in the winter – we're in July!!!\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nHome prices continue to increase. The **median sales price came in at $530,000** in July 2024 compared to $499,900 in July 2023.\n\nSellers, don't celebrate just yet...the median sales price only accounts for CLOSED transactions. It does not include the stale listings that have been rotting away on the market for months on end. \n\nAlso, the median sales price figures do not account for \"seller credits\" (i.e. the seller contributing money towards the buyer's closing costs). It's not uncommon in this market for the seller to contribute 1% - 3% of the home price to incentivize buyers to make an offer.\n\n![July - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_8_a68933f8f9.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nThe saving grace is that mortgage rates have finally started to show some relief. We ended July with an **average 30-year fixed rate of 6.848%** and spoiler alert – they've come down even further since then, 6.62% as of August 2nd!\n\nWill lower rates bring buyers back to the market?!\n\n![July - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_9_3708f91842.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In: \n\nHomes have remained just as unaffordable as they were in July 2023. Is this the new normal? Are high monthly payments something buyers just need to get used to?\n\nIf not, one of two things needs to happen – **either prices come down or interest rates come down**. It's that simple.\n\nLet's say you're a household earning $120,000 per year. A good rule of thumb is that your housing expenses (principal, interest, property taxes, and insurance) shouldn't exceed 28% of your pre-tax income. This translates to around $2,800 per month on housing. \n\nThe median price of a home in Davidson County was $530,000 in July. Let's say you put down 10% and finance $477,000. You would **need an interest rate of 5.25%** to comfortably afford the house.\n\n![July - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_10_b273bcb0a9.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

This is about **150 listings fewer than both August 2023 and 2022** (*See chart below*). \n\nFor those of you rooting for home prices to increase, fewer homes coming to the market is a welcomed sign.\n\nI expect to see the number of new listings added each month begin to decrease from now until the end of the year as most home sellers prefer to time their sales to take place in the spring or summer months. \n\n![2500x1604.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_9cd8b566b3.png)\n\nI like to think of the chart above as more of a snapshot in time – a single picture. \n\nThe chart below on the other hand is like a video – it shows the aggregate number of new listings added to the market each month since January.\n\nIn my opinion, looking at the aggregate chart is a better representation of overall supply. **Since January 2024, 10,435 new listings have been added to the market – nearly identical to the market in 2022** (*See chart below*).\n\n![2500x1604 (1).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_1_ff91687572.png)\n\nSo, supply continues to look fairly normal, but what about demand? Taking a look at the total inventory chart, we can see that something is off (*See chart below*).\n\n![2500x1604 (2).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_2_cc4e5ea663.png)\n\n**Inventory in Davison County began to climb starting in March and the gap has continued to widen compared to 2023 and 2022.**\n\nFor example, in August 2024, the total inventory on the market was 3,479. August 2023 on the other hand saw a total inventory of 3,117. **So, there are roughly 10% more listings on the market now compared to this time last year**.\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nWhy is total inventory climbing if the number of new listings added each month is about the same as in years past? It comes down to demand. \n\nJune, July, and August have all been disappointing months in terms of demand. **August 2024 had just 669 closings – 20% fewer than August 2023** (*See chart below*).\n\nWhether it's due to high interest rates, the upcoming presidential election, geopolitical uncertainty, or all of the above – buyers just aren't showing up to the table.\n\n![2500x1604 (3).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_3_1982771089.png)\n\n**My prediction is that we'll end the year with just over 7,700 closings compared to 8,284 in 2023 and 9,968 in 2022.**\n\n![2500x1604 (4).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_4_74a3f970e4.png)\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nNow that we've analyzed the supply side of the market and the demand side of the market separately, it's time to tie them together. \n\nThe months of supply is arguably the most important statistic in real estate as it determines how long it would take to sell all the homes currently on the market if the current sales pace and inventory levels remained the same.\n\n![2500x1604 (5).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_5_9c387ecfa9.png)\n\nWe noticed an unusual spike in the months of supply in June (*See chart above*). While still elevated, it has begun to level off. \n\n**As of August 2024, months of supply was 4.51. In other words, it would take approximately four and a half months for the inventory to dry up given the current pace of closings.**\n\nMy prediction is that we'll end the year with months of supply well over 5 which would be a welcomed sign for buyer's hoping to purchase a home. After all, more choices and less competition among other buyers generally lead to better terms and lower prices.\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nThe median and average home prices tell two different stories. On one hand, the average sales price in Davidson County continues to climb – up nearly 6% compared to a year ago. The median home price on the other hand is flat. Why you ask?\n\nI attribute this to the handful of extraordinarily expensive home sales taking place in specific enclaves of Davidson County such as Green Hills, Belle Meade, Forest Hills, and Oak Hill. These sales, many of which are paid in cold hard cash, continue to push up the average home price.\n\n**Rest assured that for the typical home buyer or seller in Davidson County, prices have remained relatively flat since early 2022.**\n\n![2500x1604 (6).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_6_c0913378fb.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates saw some much-needed relief in August! The same day that the stock market fell nearly 600 points in early August, the mortgage market had a similar correction. \n\n**On Thursday, July 25th, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.90%. By August 5th, the rate plummeted to 6.34%!**\n\nFor those of you who are expecting mortgage rates to drop another 0.25% after the Fed's rate cut this September – don't get too excited. The mortgage market has already priced in the cut. \n\nThat being said, it's likely rates will continue to come down over the next 6-12 months. **My prediction is that we'll see the average 30-year mortgage in the high 5% range in 2025.**\n\n![2500x1604 (7).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1604_7_896aa271f1.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In:\n\nI've decided to change up my affordability analysis slightly by taking the median sales price into consideration.\n\nAugust's affordability analysis offers a glimmer of hope for those of us asking for more affordable real estate.\n\n**Even accounting for the slight increase in median sales price since 2022, the monthly payment (assuming a 20% down payment) in August 2024 is $136 lower than in August 2023!** \n\nWe're still nowhere near 2022's affordability but it's a step in the right direction.\n\n![2500x1632.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1632_74efac252e.png)\n\nUsing my old analysis which assumes a loan amount of $500,000, the affordability looks even better! August 2024's monthly payment comes in at $190 less than August 2023's.\n\n![2500x1408.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2500x1408_e03a26784e.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

The supply side of the market has been extremely consistent throughout the year. The number of new listings added each month is in line with 2022 and 2023. \n\nSeptember 2024 saw 1,161 new listings added across Davidson County. As we head into winter, we should start to see this number decline with seasonal trends (*See chart below*).\n\n![September - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_2_1de553a5d0.png)\n\nThe total number of listings added since the beginning of the year also remains consistent (*See chart below*). \n\nAt the current pace, we should end the year with about 14,000 listings added since January.\n\n![September - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_3_f484bf49af.png)\n\nSo, the supply-side of the market remains pretty boring. What about demand?\n\nTotal inventory, which includes homes that are coming soon, active, or under contract, continued to grow (*See chart below*).\n \n![September - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_4_486afec245.png)\n\nAlthough total inventory is up 13% compared to this time last year, we have yet to see this result in a major price correction like what's taken place in the [Austin real estate market](https://www.kxan.com/news/housing/austin-round-rock-metro-at-highest-inventory-of-home-listings-since-2011-pushing-median-prices-down/).\n\nTo see home prices in Nashville really start to decline, we would likely need to see total inventory up 20% or even 25% given the current levels of demand.\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nSomething very interesting happened on the demand side in September  – **the number of homes that went under contract increased by over 17% compared to the previous year** (*See chart below*).\n\n![September - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_5_9c2401e1de.png)\n\nIt's as if a bunch of buyers who were sitting on the sidelines came back to the market. And, this didn't just show up in the market data. Personally, I had five or six buyers call me in September to start their home search and, I had four of my listings go under contract!\n\n**What's the catalyst for this sudden resurgence of buyers? Two words – Interest Rates.**\n\nI've said for some time now that the 30-year mortgage rate needs to be below 6% to spur demand. In my opinion, it's a psychological threshold and whether or not it makes sense, prospective homebuyers are a lot more willing to make a purchase if their interest rate is 5.99% vs 6.01%.\n\nLooking at the chart below, the number of closings in September looked pretty depressing. But, all of you smart folks who are reading this right now will know that if the \"New Under Contract\" data is any indication, we should see in increase in the number of closings come October.\n\n![September - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_6_aa4a1b4a30.png)\n\nEven if the number of closings in October outperforms, we'll still be in a demand rut compared to years past. If we keep the current pace of demand, we are likely to end the year with about 8,200 closings since January.\n\n![September - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_7_4878b4cbe3.png)\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nFor those of you hoping for prices to go significantly up or down, I wouldn't hold your breath. **The \"Months of Supply\", which spiked in June has plateaued and remained steady around 4.5 months**.\n\nKeep in mind, months of supply is seasonal. If 2022 and 2023 are any indication, we should see it peak in November. And, while it was unusual for it to increase so drastically this year in June, my prediction is the months of supply will close the gap in October when most of those pending sales close. \n\n![September - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_8_0ff58213b0.png)\n\nThe average days on market before going under contract has remained consistent as well. In Davidson County, days on market remains in the mid-20s. \n\nWe should see this number increase slightly heading into winter.\n\n![September - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_9_4af9055e9a.png)\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nI know what you're thinking – who cares about supply and demand, YOU want to know how home prices are performing!\n\n**September was a historic month for Davidson County home prices. It was the first month in 2024 where home prices were down year-over-year**. Let me say that again so it sinks in – September 2024 was the first month in 2024 where we saw prices lower than the same month in 2023.\n\n**The average sales price was down 8% compared to September 2023 and the median sales price was down just over 1%** (*See chart below*).\n\nWas this a one-time fluke or is this the beginning of a longer trend? If you are lucky enough to have one, feel free to ask your crystal ball.\n\n![September - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_10_d1a7b1da0b.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates saw a ton of relief in September due to the market pricing in the anticipated Fed rate cuts. \n\n**Before you start jumping up and down with joy, I hate to burst your bubble but rates moved sharply higher in October :/**\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year mortgage in September was 6.18% and I even had a client with excellent credit lock in a 5.25% without paying any points. I can honestly say that I haven't seen a 5.25% rate in a loooonnnnnggggg time.\n\n**As of October 11th, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.64%**.\n\n![September - 11.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_11_6587d8c8cb.png)\n\nFor those of you scratching your head saying, \"Didn't the Fed just cut rates, why are they higher?\" Here is an [excellent explainer video](https://x.com/StealthQE4/status/1843469920887345365) on how mortgage rates are actually determined (spoiler alert: they're not based on the Fed Funds Rate).\n\n### Affordability Check-In:\n\nWith home prices down slightly,  and mortgage rates down significantly, September was by far the most affordable month to buy a home in 2024. \n\n**Based solely on the chart below, we are almost back to 2022 levels of affordability in Davidson County**. \n\n![September - 12.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_12_5ed3d7c5ab.png)\n\nHere's the same analysis using a consistent $500,000 loan amount. As you can see, the monthly payment in September 2024 is only $23 more than September 2022 and $297 less than September 2023. I'll take that as a win for home affordability!\n\n![September - 13.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/September_13_c47776a70f.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

The number of new listings in Davidson County added to Realtracs in October was 1,103. This was in line with the number of listings added in 2022 and 2023 – not much of a surprise there (*See chart below*).\n\n![October - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_2_cf88b2a0fa.png)\n\nFor those of you who read my market updates religiously, first off – thank you!! I've never considered myself to be the best writer but I hope I'm able to distill the information in a way that is easy to understand.\n\nFolks that have been following along this year already know that the supply-side of the market has looked fairly normal. The number of listings added since the beginning of the year is on pace to match 2022's number – just over 14,000 (*See chart below*). \n\n![October - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_3_356f5b7a0b.png)\n\nLooking at the total inventory, we start to get a glimpse at the demand-side of the market. This is where things start to look a little different compared to 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn October, the number of homes on the market hit 3,539 – the highest number we've had all year, slightly beating out the previous month (*See chart below*).\n \n![October - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_4_1396ffb5c5.png)\n\nIn short, yes, inventory is growing, however, it is not at a pace that should sound any alarms.\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nMore homes went under contract in October 2024 than in years past (*See chart below*). This was likely a result of buyers who came back to the market when interest rates dropped for all of about two weeks.\n\n![October - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_5_a796f89772.png)\n\nThe demand side of the market actually looked decent during the month of October. Since June 2024, the number of closings each month has trailed the 2023 numbers. October was the first month where there was a slight increase in the number of closings compared to the year prior (*See chart below*).\n\n![October - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_6_8cb961d3e9.png)\n\nIn aggregate, we're still trailing both 2022 and 2023. It's not rocket science, demand has slowed down in response to high mortgage rates.\n\n![October - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_7_7d3a9b5725.png)\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nWhen my clients ask me whether it's a 'buyer's market' or 'seller's market' I always like to say that it's not as black or white as that. I like to think of it as a gradient. \n\nCurrently, I'd definitely say we're trending toward a stronger buyer's market, especially if mortgage rates continue to stay elevated.\n\n![October - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_8_9840ba04f8.png)\n\nA good way to answer the age-old 'buyer's market' vs 'seller's market' question quantitatively is to look at the months of supply.\n\nMonths of supply tells us how much inventory is out there given the current pace of demand. \n\n**High Months of Supply = Strong Buyer's Market**\n\nI've stressed this key stat in my market updates ever since it spiked in June – a month when months of supply is typically pretty low. \n\nIt's no surprise that months of supply increased in October and will likely continue to increase through the remainder of the year due to the seasonality of the real estate market (*See chart below*).\n\n![October - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_9_10123a101b.png)\n\nAverage days on market stayed steady at 27 days (*See chart below*). This number isn't always the most accurate as agents routinely take listings off the market to \"refresh\" them thus resetting the days on market.\n\nThat said, I'm a true believer that homes should sell within 45 days no matter the market conditions. If it takes longer than 45 days to get an offer, it's time to reevaluate the list price or marketing approach.\n\n![October - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_10_b7ef6a79ab.png)\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nDespite the lackluster demand, home prices remain resilient. The median sales price in Davison County was $495,000 in October, up 1% from a year before.\n\nThe average home price on the other hand had its second month of large declines – down nearly 8% compared to October 2023 (*See chart below*). \n\n![October - 11.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_11_6c05681091.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates oh mortgage rates! \n\nJust as things were looking up, we're right back to 7% interest rates again. We all know that the Fed agreed to a 0.50% rate cut in September. My last market update did a good job explaining why mortgage rates didn't drop despite the fed cut.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed rate mortgage as of November 4th was 7.05%. While it's lower than this time last year, we're still a long way from what I consider the Goldilocks Zone (under 6%). \n\n![October - 12.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_12_a03efefd58.png)\n\nInflation is here to stay – possibly long-term. If that's the case, I wouldn't expect much lower mortgage rates anytime soon.\n\n![October - 13.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_13_9ee626ca60.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In:\n\nEven though rates are higher and prices rose slightly, October was still a win in my book for home affordability. The average monthly payment came in just under $2,500 per month assuming a 20% down payment.\n\n![October - 14.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_14_86b861b858.png)\n\nEven better – October 2024 had the lowest October interest rates in two years...now that's scary!\n\n![October - 15.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_15_f7b45d462e.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

Achieving sub-5% rates in 2025 could dramatically reshape the market landscape.**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## November In-Depth Analysis\n\n### 2025 Housing Market Predictions: \n\nBefore we jump into the Nashville housing market, many of the top real estate authorities just came out with their predictions on how the national housing market will perform in 2025. \n\nTake a look below and let me know what you think! \n\n![November - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_2_7a9c2d22d4.png)\n\n### Supply-Side: \n\nLet's look at the supply-side of the market and start with the number of new listings added in November. Based on the data from Realtracs, 904 new listings were added in November 2024 compared to 1,013 in November 2023 (*See chart below*).\n\n![November - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_3_62c220b013.png)\n\nJust as I predicted a few months back, we'll likely end the year with about 14,500 new listings added to the market since January – on par with 2022 (*See chart below*). \n\n![November - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_4_edad7b3043.png)\n\nTotal inventory remains elevated compared to 2022 and 2023 levels, however, the gap is starting to close slightly.  (See chart below).\n \n![November - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_5_41bc02de14.png)\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nShifting to the demand-side, the number of homes that were under contract in November surprised to the upside! Compared to a year prior, the number of under-contract listings is up nearly 30% (*See chart below*)! \n\nThis is likely a byproduct of the slightly lower interest rates we experienced in the run-up to the September Fed rate cut.\n\n![November - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_6_913f3b90c4.png)\n\nInterestingly, the number of closings in November 2024 remained consistent with previous years (*See chart below*). \n\nI predict the number of closings in December to outpace 2023 and 2024 as the homes that are currently under contract begin to close.\n\n![November - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_7_85f3040da1.png)\n\nEven if we experience a strong December, it's likely that the aggregate number of closings since the beginning of the year will underperform 2023. \n\n![November - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_8_cb200f467a.png)\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nThe Felix Market Meter remains unchanged compared to a month ago. Overall, the market throughout middle Tennessee seems to be healthy. \n\nThings could change in 2025 based on the economic and political agenda. The main thing to be keeping an eye on is inflation since it plays a crucial role in determining interest rates.\n\n![November - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_9_f890f1cd79.png)\n\nThe months of supply has increased with the seasonal trend as expected (*See chart below*). \n\nHistorically, months of supply is the highest in November so it will be interesting to see if it decreases when the December data is released. \n\n![November - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_10_5bf9ad6a5e.png)\n\nSimilar to the months of supply, the average days on market also increased with seasonal trends as homes stay on the market a bit longer (*See chart below*).\n\n![November - 11.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_11_acd48383d8.png)\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nDespite the increase in the months of supply, both the average and median sales prices were up in November (*See chart below*). \n\nThe median sales price increased to $522,500 – up over 5.5% compared to November 2023. \n\n![November - 12.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_12_f19d9792e3.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates continued to increase throughout the month of November as well. As of 12/3, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.91%.\n\nAll I can say is this Thanksgiving, I was thankful that rates dipped back below 7%. \n\n![November - 13.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_13_5a9f375f8d.png)\n\nThat said, we're still a long way off from the sub-5% \"Goldilocks zone\". But, if we can achieve this in 2025, I think many of the \"expert forecasts\" above may need to make a revision. \n\n![November - 14.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_14_d51ec021c2.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In:\n\nNot much has changed on the affordability front. The average 30-year mortgage interest rate is the same as it was in 2022, however, the median sales price in Davidson County is up over 8% since then. \n\n![November - 15.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_15_6d2470a740.png)\n\nKeeping the loan amount constant, you can see that we're looking slightly better than 2023 but rates or prices have to come down to make housing truly affordable for the majority of Americans.\n\n![November - 16.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_16_e970d047c7.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

On their way home, they often find themselves thinking they should just move to Tennessee for good.

It'll help you decide if moving to Tennessee should be your next adventure, and provide insight into the best spots to call home.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Major Cities In Tennessee?\n\nTennesseans aren't ones to brag, but they have more than their fair share of cities to be proud of. Unlike towns in some other areas of the U.S., each of the state's population centers has its own distinct character, landscape, and appeal. From Memphis along the Mississippi to Knoxville in the Appalachians, Tennessee offers a nearly unparalleled combination of unique cities.\n\n### Nashville\n\n![Image of two girls standing in front of a mural in Nashville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Nashville_mural_e93790fb88.jpg)\n\nThere are a number of reasons that [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville) headlines Tennessee's urban lineup. The capital city is right in the middle of the state and has the highest metro population, of nearly 2 million residents. It's not just the hub of Tennessee, but also one of the Southeast's cultural centerpieces. The nightlife, whether on Broadway, at Five Points, or any of the city's other social hotspots, is unparalleled. Apart from that, Nashville's collection of colleges (including Vanderbilt University), and historical icons like the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium, lend the city a nearly endless inventory of attractions. Perhaps that's why it's one of the fastest-growing cities in the entire U.S. If you're thinking about [moving to Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-nashville) specifically, check our guide on what makes the music city a great place.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our picks for the top 10 suburbs in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-suburbs-of-nashville-real-estate)**\n\n### Knoxville\n\nThis valley town, nestled between the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, has been a nucleus of Appalachian life for generations. From its location along the Tennessee River, a town that began as a clearinghouse for the mountains' natural resources, evolved into a regional center for tourism and Appalachian culture. Today it's home to the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, the state's flagship university, and many landmarks, like the Tennessee Theatre and the \"Sunsphere\" from the 1982 World's Fair. And even though the fair may have left town, Knoxville remains one of Tennessee's great destinations.\n\n### Memphis\n\n![Image of a man and a woman standing in front of a sign that says the words \"Memphis\"](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/moving_to_tennessee_1_da2e4d1156_b8def6d923.jpg)\n\nNashville may have the shiniest music scene, but Memphis, along the banks of the Mississippi River, will always be the ancestral home of the blues. The neon lights of Beale Street still illuminate live music played in the same places where names like Elvis, Cash, and Aretha got their start. To this day, millions of Elvis Presley's admirers make their way to Graceland, his mansion, to pay tribute to The King of Rock N' Roll. Yet, Memphis is about more than just music. FedEx calls the city home, thus continuing Memphis's long-standing reputation as a transportation hub. And the National Civil Rights Museum is also there, in recognition of the town's tragic past (Memphis is the site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination) and hopeful future. Plus, you will never go hungry with the food scene and bbq around town.\n\n### Chattanooga\n\nChattanooga is a smaller city that sits on the state border of Georgia and Tennessee. This railroad town has always been notable for its contributions to the Southern manufacturing economy and its key role in the Civil War, but lately, it has also evolved into a haven for tourism. Destinations like Ruby Falls, Rock City (have you seen it?), and the Tennessee Aquarium make Chattanooga one of the best visits in the state. It also doesn't hurt that its position along the Tennessee River, right at the foot of the Appalachians, is about as picturesque as it gets. Since the TVA created a reservoir system to keep the valley from flooding, Chattanooga has been able to develop into a city worthy of its beautiful location.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The History Of Tennessee?\n\nTennessee started out as part of North Carolina but gained statehood in 1796. It didn't get its nickname, \"The Volunteer State\", until the War of 1812, when droves of the state's residents fought to defend the young United States. This sense of duty continued during the Mexican-American War and the Civil War when Tennessee had the paradoxical distinction of supplying the most Confederate and Union regiments of any Confederate state. Tennessee has historically been known for its diverse natural resources and economic landscape. Until the early 1900s, when railroad development rendered steamboats mostly obsolete, Memphis was the premier stop along the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the eastern part of the state was functioning as a hub for marble, iron, coal, and other natural resources provided by the mountains. During the Great Depression, when the TVA started turning Tennessee into the nation's largest supplier of public utilities, the state really started to take off economically. The Manhattan Project even created a research facility in the state that used the ample power for missile development. Alongside all this, Tennessee gained a reputation as an artistic and travel hub that is still drawing many visitors today.\n\n## What Is Tennessee Know For?\n\nTennessee's reputation, frankly, defies summarization. It's a music-loving, football-crazy, history-filled state with more attractions and features than one could see in a lifetime. Its system of rivers and lakes rivals any in the country, and its mountains boast some of the highest peaks east of the Rockies. On top of that, four distinct cities each provide a different way to experience the state. However, if we have to choose, Tennessee is probably most notable for...\n\n### The Smoky Mountains\n\nSince The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established in 1934, it has put Tennessee on the map as a place of accessible natural beauty. The Appalachian Trail runs right through the park along the TN-NC border and offers just a taste of the unbelievable hiking the area has to offer. It's the most-visited national park in the country, and the state has done a wonderful job complementing the natural world with some beloved entertainment options. Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge are both prime mountain tourist destinations just outside the park's borders. Gatlinburg is essentially a carnival in the Appalachians, with its own aquarium, huge ropes courses, and SkyBridge, the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in North America. Pigeon Forge, its neighbor and tourism rival, has its own long list of attractions headlined by Dollywood, the theme park based on the state's own Dolly Parton.\n\n### Country Music\n\n![Image of people standing inside the country music hall of fame located in downtown Nashville](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HOF_6fc8fe9dc8.jpg)\n\nTennessee may be the home of the Blues, but country music defines its reputation today. Some of the earliest country music, with its signature fiddle, came out of the state's mountains. Now, the genre calls Nashville home. Dozens of stars, like Taylor Swift (we still count her!), Jason Isbell, and Chris Stapleton, reside in and around Nashville, with more moving in every day. The Ryman Auditorium, the Bluebird Cafe, and the Grand Ole Opry are just a few of the signature spots for live shows. With modern venues like the Ascend Amphitheater and the Country Music Hall of Fame popping up seemingly every year, country music isn't finding a new home any time soon.\n\n## How's The Cost Of Living In Tennessee?\n\nLike any large area, the [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) will vary based on the city. In general, though, Tennessee is quite reasonable compared to most of the country. \n\n### Which parts of Tennessee have a low cost of living?\n\nIn general, your dollar goes further in smaller towns. In fact, eight Tennessee towns rank in the top 100 for [best places to relocate to](https://www.movebuddha.com/blog/popular-small-city-list/). When there are fewer residents and more space, housing costs tend to be lower. That's why places like Johnson City and Clarksville boast living costs well below the national average and have positioned themselves as pleasant, inexpensive places to live. Lucky for Tennessee, even more-populated areas are still very affordable. Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis, for instance, are relatively cheap mainly because of their reasonable housing costs. This makes Tennessee one of the rare states where you can get cosmopolitan living without high-end prices.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See The Top 10 Most Affordable Nashville Suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs)**\n\n### Which parts of Tennessee have a high cost of living?\n\nJust about the only locale in Tennessee where the cost of living slides above the national average is Nashville. This isn't some huge surprise. Nashville has some of the nicest neighborhoods and homes in the entire country, with entertainment and amenities to match. Considering everything it has to offer, it's remarkable that the Nashville-metro area's overall living costs are just barely higher than the national average. More affordable communities outside Nashville, like Murfreesboro, make living in Nashville more attainable.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See The 20 Most Exclusive Neighborhoods In Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-nashville)**\n\n## How's The Economy In Tennessee?\n\nTennessee's economy was in the midst of an unprecedented upswing when the pandemic hit. The unemployment rate was at a record-low 3.3%, corporations were flourishing, and tourism was thriving. Even as those economic indicators take a hit, though, Tennessee's economy has still gracefully withstood the pressures of 2020. The state's unemployment is around 5%, and job creation has continued. Many aspects of life over the past 12 months may have changed, but Tennessee's overall economic outlook has remained strong.\n\n### What are the pros of Tennessee's economy?\n\nCorporations are catching on to Tennessee for its favorable labor laws and exceptionally low state tax rates (including no state income tax!). A range of companies, including FedEx, International Paper, Dollar General, and Cracker Barrel have made the state their headquarters. Many more, like Tyson Chicken and Nissan, operate massive plants and other facilities within the state's borders. Besides its reputation as a corporate haven, Tennessee also draws millions of visitors every year. Nashville, Memphis, and the mountains combine to create a statewide swath of tourist attractions that draw lots of money into the state's borders.\n\n### What are the cons of Tennessee's economy?\n\nLike everywhere, Tennessee's small towns have seen their fair share of decay as money and talent clusters in the more urban areas. Out of all the state's big cities, Knoxville has shown limited job growth. While this may be a little troubling, the university and consistent tourism still give Knoxville a favorable economic floor.\n\n### How's the job market in Tennessee?\n\nThough Tennessee lags behind other parts of the country with average wages, you are likely not to notice due to the low cost of living. Major cities in Tennessee have large companies that bring many jobs. In Middle Tennessee, these include huge healthcare companies like HCA, Community Health Systems, Vanderbilt, and Saint Thomas. Other big players in Nashville include Nissan, Vanderbilt University, Asurion, and Amazon. Outside of Nashville, major employers also include Fed- Ex in Memphis and Oak Ridge Labratory in Knoxville.\n\n## How Are The Schools In Tennessee?\n\n### Top school districts in Tennessee\n\nConsidering Tennessee's diversity and size, the state maintains an impressive system of public education. Germantown, a suburb of Memphis, is considered the best overall school district, while just outside Knoxville, Maryville takes the second-place spot. The Arlington and Kingsport school districts are also top-notch, and various [Nashville suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts), like [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin), [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), and [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), have outstanding public and private schools. Franklin, Brentwood, Nolensville, and Spring Hill are all in Williamson County.\n\n### Top public schools in Tennessee\n\nThe state's best public high schools tend to belong to big city suburbs, particularly the ones that surround Nashville. US News ranks Merrol Hyde Magnet School in [Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville), a suburb of Nashville, as the top high school in the state and a top-three school in the entire nation. High schools in and around Nashville take the first seven spots in the rankings, followed closely by specialized high schools from other areas, like Knoxville's L\u0026N Stem Academy.\n\n### Top private schools in Tennessee\n\nMost private schools are clustered around Memphis and Nashville, but nearly every major metropolitan area offers a great private school option for your child's education. According to Niche.com, the University School of Nashville and Memphis's St. Mary's Episcopal School receive the top marks. Chattanooga's Baylor School and the Webb School of Knoxville are great options in the state's slightly smaller locales. If you're looking at boarding school options, McCallie School just outside of Chattanooga is also a famous institution for all-boys education.\n\n## How Is The Real Estate Market In Tennessee?\n\nIt may have been a difficult year for the overall economy, but that hasn't stopped [Tennessee's booming real estate market](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-real-estate-market-update). People attracted by Tennessee's forgiving taxes, affordable living costs, and ample space are fleeing other states, and their presence is helping to drive the market higher across the boards. Every major metropolitan area has seen a considerable increase in average sale prices over the last year, and even smaller towns are starting to show nice upticks in home prices.\n\n### Are homes expensive in Tennessee?\n\nIn most towns, inexpensive homes are the primary reason that the state maintains such an accessible economic threshold for living. Home values in areas like Knoxville or Chattanooga, even though they've lately been rising, are still some of the best you'll find in a city. Many people find suitable homes for around, or even under, $200K. Those who move to Tennessee might be a little less thrilled by the 'big city' Nashville market, where average home prices hover just under $350K, with numerous areas reaching values considerably higher than that. This may not be music to your ears, especially if you're considering a move, but there's simply not a more desirable area in the state. Also, Nashville home values have consistently increased over the years, so despite the price, it remains a good investment.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See Nashville homes for sale](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville)**\n\n### How much are property taxes in Tennessee?\n\nTennessee's property taxes are famously low. Residents usually pay around half as much in property taxes per year as the average United States citizen. Exact property tax rates depend on the county (0.5% of the assessed value is a good estimate), but regardless of the location, property taxes make moving to Tennessee a particularly promising proposition.\n\n## Moving To Tennessee Pros And Cons\n\nOver the last 20 years, Tennessee has enjoyed an impressive rate of population growth. Low tax rates, living costs, and high quality of life have kept people on the move to Tennessee. It's not a perfect place, but for the price, Tennessee is about as good as one can get.\n\n### Top 5 Pros to moving to Tennessee\n\n#### **Low property taxes**\n\nWe'll say it again: Tennessee has one of the lowest property tax rates in the country, which makes it one of the best states to own property. If you plan on staying for a while, Tennessee's property tax policy will keep money in your pocket for years to come.\n\n#### **No state income tax**\n\nThat's right, there's no state income tax, so you get to keep as much of what you earn as possible. That's why your income goes as far in Tennessee as just about any other area in the country. The state compensates for this income tax break with a higher-than-average sales tax (around 7%). This ensures that Tennessee's visitors help the residents cover a large chunk of their living costs.\n\n#### **Low cost of living**\n\nLow taxes tend to mean low living expenses as well. Between this favorable tax structure and reasonable real estate prices, the result is a place where you know your income and savings work hard for you. Wherever you're living in Tennessee, chances are your daily expenses are well below the national average. And even if you're looking to move to Nashville, you won't be paying much more than the average American.\n\n#### **Tennessee mountains and lakes**\n\nTennessee is home to dozens of large and beautiful lakes, some of which are situated close to urban areas. The Nashville suburbs, for instance, are home to Old Hickory Lake and the Percy Priest Reservoir. While these lakes are distributed across the state, a multitude of them is nestled amongst the beautiful Appalachian Mountains, where multiple peaks rise well over 6,000 feet. These offer some of the best hiking and scenery in the entire United States. It's all the perfect place for a boating enthusiast.\n\n#### **Mild climate**\n\nTennessee's climate is one of the most comfortable in the country. Although average temperatures rise as you move farther west toward the Mississippi River, the entire state enjoys cool winters and long, warm summers. Most places, and especially the mountains, get the occasional snow and ice storm, but spring generally arrives quickly once March comes around.\n\n### Top 5 Cons to moving to Tennessee\n\n#### **Country music (unless you're a fan!)**\n\nCountry music is just a given in most parts of Tennessee. Live music is everywhere from hotels to bars to parks, and this isn't changing any time soon. If country music is what you want, then you're in the right place! Those who aren't fans of the genre, though, might not be so thrilled about the state's preferred soundtrack.\n\n#### **Cost of living is rising**\n\nTennessee's [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) is incredibly low, but it may not always stay that way. A few desirable areas, like Nashville, are slowly becoming more expensive. In fact, [Davidson County's property taxes increased 34% recently](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike). That said, most areas are unlikely to break your bank, but if you're looking to save money it's best to avoid the trendiest spots.\n\n#### **Landlocked state**\n\nIf you're all about coastal living or you have a \"Salt Life\" sticker on the back of your car, then Tennessee might not be what you're looking for. Tennessee may have its fair share of rivers and lakes although it's hours from sandy ocean beaches.\n\n#### **Humid climate**\n\nLet's just say that the term \"dry heat\" isn't something a lot of Tennesseans are familiar with. Tennessee's relative humidity is around 70%, which is middle of the pack within the U.S. However, combine that humidity rate with Southeastern summers and, well, it's not most people's idea of comfort. Luckily, those summers are still fairly mild for the Southeast, and over the years you'll appreciate how the extra moisture in the air keeps the drought risk minimal.\n\n#### **Slow to change**\n\nWe don't need to go through all the stereotypes, but generally, southern states has a tendency to move a little slower. This is sometimes a good thing, like when it comes to tinkering with your favorite hot chicken recipe. Sometimes though, it can be frustrating. New ideas take time to find a cultural foothold, whether they're as important as creating a more inclusive society, or as trivial as wishing you had a closer Chipotle. In fact, Tennessee is one of only ten states in the country where it is illegal for a real estate buyer's agent to offer their client a commission rebate ([although Felix Homes has a way around this](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee)). That doesn't mean, however, that Tennessee isn't trying to get with the times. Especially in urban areas, new types of people are coming to stay and bringing a fresh perspective with them. Tennessee is as open to change as ever and becoming more flexible in meeting every need...just don't mess with the hot chicken recipe.\n\n## Is Moving To Tennessee A Good Idea?\n\nWe don't know if [living in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) is your next step, but plenty of people have answered this question with a resounding yes! Job prospects are great, living costs are limited, and you'll never run out of things to do. Visitors often come for a weekend and realize immediately after leaving that they want to make Tennessee their home.\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for young professionals?\n\nIt's no secret what young professionals are looking for: nightlife, restaurants, convenience, and plenty of other young people to get to know. There are neighborhoods in cities like Chattanooga and Memphis that cater to this demographic, but for the [ultimate young professional lifestyle](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals), nothing compares to Nashville. The city's unparalleled neighborhood bar scene means that you don't have to venture downtown for a good night out, and plenty of chic rental properties make for accessible urban living. Then, if you want to hit the music and bar scene downtown, it's an easy 5 minute Uber ride. [The Nations](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-nations), [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills), [Germantown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/germantown), [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville), and [The Gulch](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-gulch) are just a few entries on the extensive list of convenient neighborhoods. Or you could just live [downtown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) with all the action right outside your window.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's The Top 6 Nashville Neighborhoods for Singles \u0026 Young Professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals)**\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for families?\n\nWe hate to keep going back to the old standby, but yet again we have to give the nod to [Nashville's Suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-suburbs-of-nashville-real-estate). It simply offers the most enticing combination of location, activities, schools, and properties. The best part is, there's a suburb for every budget. Neighborhoods like [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills), [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), and [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) are some of the best communities in the Southeast but can be prohibitively expensive. Luckily, areas like [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), and [Mount Juliet](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/mount-juliet) offer plenty of family-friendly features in a more affordable real estate market. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out the best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for retirees?\n\nThere are plenty of areas in Tennessee where retirees can stretch their dollars without sacrificing space and amenities. Which one you choose depends on the retirement lifestyle you would like to pursue. If you'd like to while away the years in the mountains, we suggest communities along Tellico Lake just south of Knoxville. Plenty of nice shorelines, large lots, and forgiving tax laws will keep you as comfortable as possible. For more urban-centric retirees, [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) really can't be beaten. Living costs are high, but it's a cultural hub with an astonishing restaurant and arts scene that certainly never gets old.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our top 10 places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee)**\n\n### Should you move from California to Tennessee?\n\nThat depends. New residents are coming from California every day. The factors pushing them to Tennessee are lower cost of living, less traffic, and shorter commutes. If that's appealing, a new Tennessee home may be for you. There are some downsides for Californians moving to Tennessee: tornadoes, no oceans, and a challenging market for buyers in many of Tennessee's most desirable areas.\n\n## Is Tennessee A Safe Place?\n\nNo area is perfectly safe, but we have to admit that some are safer than others, and perhaps no other factor is more important when considering where to move. Fortunately, Tennessee offers plenty of low-risk residential options that will tax your nerves about as much as they'll tax your income (a.k.a not at all).\n\n### What are the safest places to live in Tennessee?\n\nFrom a safety perspective, you can't go wrong with Nashville's premier suburbs. [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), and [Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs) are all havens situated around Tennessee's largest city. If you're thinking you'd like to go rural, though, then you'll have to see the vast tracts available in [Watertown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/watertown), just 40 miles East of Nashville. In the town of 1,700, crime is almost nonexistent.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our list of safest places to live in Tennessee in 2025](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### What are the most dangerous places to live in Tennessee?\n\nJust because you want to move to Tennessee doesn't mean there aren't places in the state you'd rather not live. Over the years, Memphis has developed a less-than-pleasant safety reputation. Unfortunately, it keeps proving that the rumors are true. There are safe places to live around Memphis, like Collierville and Germantown, but overall, Memphis sees considerably more violent crimes than any other location in Tennessee.\n\n## Conclusion–Should You Move To Tennessee?\n\nWell, it's time to deliver the verdict, and it looks like you should seriously consider moving to The Volunteer State. Living in Tennessee may not be for everyone, but if we're talking pros and cons, the advantages are staggering. Between the low cost of living, natural beauty, and endless activities, there has never been a better time to call the state home.\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is where five-star service meets low commissions!

The more and more we drive around the downtown Nashville area, the more license plates we see from all across America. People from the northeast, midwest and even southeast are flocking to Tennessee in the masses, and for good reason. The mild climate, lower cost of housing, good healthcare facilities, and pretty views of the great smoky mountains make Tennessee a [great place in terms of quality of life](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee). **But did you know Tennessee is also one of the best states for retirees?**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Why Is Tennessee A Good State For Retirees?\n\nMore and more retirees are coming to The Volunteer State to live out their golden years. Retirees find this state a great location to call home for numerous reasons.\n\n### Affordable housing and cost of living\n\nOverall, Tennessee has an [affordable cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee). The basic rules of supply and demand will apply here as well, and as more people enter the state, and very few leave, house prices are certainly expected to rise. That said, you can still get a lot of bang for your buck as the median household price is still affordable and new homes are being developed in popular cities such as Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Have you been thinking about living in Tennessee? Check out our comprehensive local guide.](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### The tax rates are favorable\n\nSeldom do the words taxes and favorable go together, but in the case of Tennessee, they do! There is no [capital gains tax](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-when-selling-a-home-in-tennessee) on your retirement income. So if you have a pension from another state, or you're living off of your 401k income, moving here will be a great way to put more money in your pocket. Who doesn't want to do that? In addition to no state income tax, the overall property tax rates are on the lower end. On average, the effective tax rate on your property is 0.74%. Although [Davidson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county), which the city of Nashville is located in just increased property taxes by 34%, they are still competitive with growing metropolitan cities like Charlotte and Atlanta. This low rate is difficult to pass up compared to other areas in the nation.\n\n### The mild climate\n\nThe northeast can see bitter cold winters and the south can be excessively hot in the summer. [Tennessee is a nice blend of both extremes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). Our climate is mild. We get the beautiful 4 seasons, but our winters are not nearly as cold as our friends up north, and our summers are not as humid as the more southern states. Seeing as most retirees prefer warmer climates, this makes Tennessee a great option to consider!\n\n### Tennessee has a beautiful landscape\n\nThe beauty in Tennessee is hard to describe. There is arguably nothing prettier than having the great smoky mountains as a backdrop or [living along the hundreds of lakeshore miles](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-a-waterfront-property-in-tennessee) throughout the state. Tennessee is also known for its rolling hills and open farmland.\n\n### Our culture and history\n\nCountry music, southern hospitality, and a slower pace of life are certainly popular attributes that catch the hearts of most retirees. Our cities still have that small-town feel, but provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. The list goes on and on. There are so many reasons why people consider retiring in Tennessee. The only difficult decision is [finding the right town or city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) to call home!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Best Place To Retire In Tennessee?\n\nThis is one of the questions we get asked a lot at Felix Homes. There are plenty of great cities to live in, or near, picking between popular cities like Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville is nearly impossible. Instead of choosing just one, we collected our list of the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\nBefore we get into the list, if you're searching for the best [retirement communities in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-retirement-communities-tennessee), we wrote another article specifically focusing on that. But, if you're just hoping to live out your retirement years in Tennessee, and not necessarily searching for a retirement community, here is a list of our top 10 places you should considering spending your retirement years.\n\n### #10 - Chattanooga\nIf you want to embrace mother nature and all her beauty, consider moving to Chattanooga. Between the banks of the Tennessee River and Appalachian mountains, you'll be surrounded by beauty 365 days a year. Not only is Chattanooga a pretty place to call home, but it is also well known for being affordable. The median home value is $230,000 per year.\n\n### #9 - Memphis\nDespite having a population of over 650,000 people, Memphis still very much feels like a small country town. Situated on the great Mississippi River, Memphis has a unique character that cannot be duplicated in any other city on our list. There are plenty of activities to do inside of the city, or if you're looking for a more laid back lifestyle in your retirement years, the suburbs of Memphis and neighboring communities make for a great place to call home. The median home value is on the low end, so you'll really be able to stretch your retirement dollar here!\n\n### #8 - Murfreesboro\nWell known for its American Civil War History, Murfreesboro makes our list at spot number eight. The affordable median home price of $250,000, and affordable tax rates, make this area a great place for retirees to live. Retired residents can enjoy playing golf at the Old Fort Golf Club, or relax at one of the beautiful outdoor parks. The large Middle Tennessee State University campus keeps the city young at heart, and you'll enjoy plenty of entertainment, shows, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Murfreesboro.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Knoxville\nSituated just an hour north of the great smoky mountains national park, and home to the legendary University of Tennessee college football team, Knoxville surely makes our list of best places to retire in Tennessee. The city of Knoxville is located in East Tennessee and is nearly 1/4 the size of Memphis with a population of 180,000 people. Housing is rather affordable with the average home price being $215,000.\n\n### #6 - Nashville\nLocated in Davidson County, Nashville has our heart and is arguably the gem of Tennessee. There's no question Nashville makes our list of best places to retire. The residents here not only enjoy an international airport which makes traveling convenient, but they are also spoiled with amazing food choices, an endless amount of live entertainment, over 100 parks, and plenty of social clubs and recreation activities all across the city. Between the art scene, and the birthplace of country music, this is undoubtedly amongst the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-nashville-tennessee)**\n\n### #5 - Oak Hill\nAlthough this area is more expensive than other areas of Tennessee, Oak Hill is attracting more and more retirees. This is far enough outside of Nashville if you're seeking a laid back lifestyle, but just a short drive into the city where you can enjoy tons of shows, plays, concerts, restaurants, and museums.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like living in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-oak-hill-in-nashville)**\n\n### #4 - Pigeon Forge / Gatlinburg\nJust 40 minutes west of the North Carolina border sits Pigeon Forge. We promise, there is nothing more satisfying than having your morning coffee on your back deck overlooking the natural beauty of the great smoky mountains. No matter the season, the smoky mountains of Tennessee will always be a magnificent sight to see. Pigeon Forge is a small town that is well known for its amazing retirement benefits. The low cost of living, pretty views, and ease of access in and out of larger cities, makes this one of the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n### #3 - Franklin\nWhy is Franklin one of the best places to retire in Tennessee? Franklin is not only a historically rich town, it's also an affluent town. The active downtown surely promises a great culture. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, museums, and a fantastic music culture, Franklin is nothing shy of an amazing place to be. Your life can be as active as you'd like. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from. From walking trails, various parks, and several public golf courses, it's no secret why the population is on the rise!\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our Franklin neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Kingston Springs\nKingston Springs is a beautiful town located in Cheatham County just 20 miles southwest of the big city (Downtown Nashville). The population is shy of 6,000 residents. Residents of Kingston Springs love the several outdoor adventures this rural town provides. Between hiking, fishing in the river, golf, or canoeing, you won't be bored here. Kingston Springs is an incredibly safe place to be with a very low crime rate. Better yet, if the outdoor activities do not keep you busy, you can drive 25 minutes to Downtown Nashville and enjoy all this large metropolitan city has to offer. Most homes in Cheatham County are on over an acre of land so Kingston Springs is our pick for retirees who prefer some privacy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)**\n\n### #1 - Tellico Lake\nThe Tellico Lake community tops our list as the best place to retire and for good reason. Anywhere along Tellico Lake is nothing shy of a dream. The lake is 33 miles long and provides over 357 miles of beautiful shoreline. Entertainment and recreation activities are endless. Between boating, fishing, golfing, hiking, and walking trails, you'll love spending your life on the lake! Roughly an hour drive to the smoky mountains and half an hour away from Knoxville, Tellico Lake provides the best of both worlds.\n\n## Areas To Avoid\nNow that we covered the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee, what are some places you should avoid?\n\n### Davidson County\nWhile the city of Nashville is located in Davidson County, if you're looking to avoid rising property taxes in your retirement years, we would suggest looking for homes outside of county limits. If you're able to put up with [higher property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike), Davidson County has a lot to offer.\n\n### Dyersburg\nDyersburg is one of the cities we'd recommend you avoid. With a population of roughly 17,000, it's surprising how high the crime rate is compared to the national average. The city has struggled to expand and develop over the years. It's located on the west end of Tennessee, and hours away from vibrant, culturally rich, cities.\n\n### Jackson\n70 miles east of Memphis is Jackson Tennessee. Unfortunately, Jackson makes the top 100 most dangerous cities in America list. Much of the city has a household income below the poverty line.\n\n## Looking To Retire In Tennessee?\nIf you're looking to retire in Tennessee, we're here to help. At [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/), we've helped countless clients find their retirement dream home. We understand everyone has their own unique goals and desires for their retirement years.\n\nSome of our clients chose to live in an active retirement community amongst other seniors seeking a social atmosphere full of amenities. Whether they are relaxing in the clubhouse, enjoying a swim at a beautiful pool, or playing golf a few times a week, these communities make for a great place to live.\n\nBut many of our clients don't want to adhere to the various restrictions or rules a 55+ community can put in place. We've helped clients find homes deep in the mountains, or right in the heart of a vibrant downtown area. From Chattanooga to Nashville, from a mountainside to a lakeshore, and everything in between, we have you covered.\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is where five-star service meets low commissions!

You can change the color of your house, update the kitchen, and add an extra bathroom. But you can't change the location of the home. Safety is a key piece to this puzzle, and we've compiled a list of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked?\n\nBefore we dive into the list of safest places to live in Tennessee, let's first define what safety means, and how a city or town tracks its safety level. There are two main crime statistics that are tracked; violent crimes and property crimes. A key thing to note is that crime rates are benchmarked per 1,000 residents. For example, if 'the violent crime rate in a city is 2 per 1,000.' That simply means, on average, 2 in every 1,000 people are victims of a violent crime. \n\n### Violent Crimes\n\nAccording to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime), violent crimes are \"composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as those offenses which involve a threat of force.\" A town with a low violent crime rate will have fewer reported violent crimes per year. \n\n### Property Crimes\n\nThe [FBI defines](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/property-crime) property crimes as the following offenses; \"burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.\" A town with a low property crime rate will have fewer instances of these crimes being reported per year. \n\nIf you're looking for the [best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee) or the [best places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee), you should be looking for a town with low property crime and violent crime rates! \n\n[**PRO TIP: Is The Volunteer State calling your name?

The population of this town is roughly 24,000 residents. Most of the residents that live in this town commute to Knoxville for work and the median home cost is below the USA average. This goes to show that you don't need to break the bank in order to live in a safe town.\n\nCrimes per 1,000 are certainly low by any standard.

This is for good reason. The state has a favorable tax system, a mild climate, and is in a convenient location. Not only that, for the most part, this state is a safe place to live! Of course, there are some parts of the state that inflate the overall crime rate, and we'll touch on that below. \n\nThe safest area of Tennessee is located in the suburbs just outside of Nashville. Many of the suburbs listed above are all within 40 minutes of Nashville. Our pick for the safest city in Tennessee is Brentwood!\n\n## What States Are Considered The Safest In The U.S.?\n\nThe North East is well known for being the safest part of the country. Maine is the safest state, but Vermont is a close second. New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut are all in the top 10 safest states in America. \n\n## How Does Nashville Compare To Similar Cities?\n\nHow does Nashville stack up against other well-known cities? Overall, Nashville ranks safer than Atlanta from both a property and violent crime rate. However, Austin, Denver, and Charlotte all have a slight safety advantage. \n\n## What Are The Top 10 Safest Cities In The U.S.?\n\nAccording to [safe wise](https://www.safewise.com/safest-cities-america/), the top 10 safest cities in America are:\n\n1.

Franklin, Massachusetts\n8. Bedford Town, New York\n9. Shrewsbury, Massachusetts\n10.

The overall Nashville crime rate gets dragged down by up-and-coming neighborhoods such as [North Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-north-nashville), [Antioch](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-antioch-in-nashville), or parts of [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-east-nashville).\n\n### Jackson\n\nLocated on the western side of the state is Jackson Tennessee.

There is no [capital gains tax](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-when-selling-a-home-in-tennessee) on your retirement income. So if you have a pension from another state, or you're living off of your 401k income, moving here will be a great way to put more money in your pocket. Who doesn't want to do that? In addition to no state income tax, the overall property tax rates are on the lower end. On average, the effective tax rate on your property is 0.74%. Although [Davidson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county), which the city of Nashville is located in just increased property taxes by 34%, they are still competitive with growing metropolitan cities like Charlotte and Atlanta. This low rate is difficult to pass up compared to other areas in the nation.\n\n### The mild climate\n\nThe northeast can see bitter cold winters and the south can be excessively hot in the summer. [Tennessee is a nice blend of both extremes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). Our climate is mild. We get the beautiful 4 seasons, but our winters are not nearly as cold as our friends up north, and our summers are not as humid as the more southern states. Seeing as most retirees prefer warmer climates, this makes Tennessee a great option to consider!\n\n### Tennessee has a beautiful landscape\n\nThe beauty in Tennessee is hard to describe. There is arguably nothing prettier than having the great smoky mountains as a backdrop or [living along the hundreds of lakeshore miles](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-a-waterfront-property-in-tennessee) throughout the state. Tennessee is also known for its rolling hills and open farmland.\n\n### Our culture and history\n\nCountry music, southern hospitality, and a slower pace of life are certainly popular attributes that catch the hearts of most retirees. Our cities still have that small-town feel, but provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. The list goes on and on. There are so many reasons why people consider retiring in Tennessee. The only difficult decision is [finding the right town or city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) to call home!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Best Place To Retire In Tennessee?\n\nThis is one of the questions we get asked a lot at Felix Homes. There are plenty of great cities to live in, or near, picking between popular cities like Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville is nearly impossible. Instead of choosing just one, we collected our list of the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\nBefore we get into the list, if you're searching for the best [retirement communities in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-retirement-communities-tennessee), we wrote another article specifically focusing on that. But, if you're just hoping to live out your retirement years in Tennessee, and not necessarily searching for a retirement community, here is a list of our top 10 places you should considering spending your retirement years.\n\n### #10 - Chattanooga\nIf you want to embrace mother nature and all her beauty, consider moving to Chattanooga. Between the banks of the Tennessee River and Appalachian mountains, you'll be surrounded by beauty 365 days a year. Not only is Chattanooga a pretty place to call home, but it is also well known for being affordable. The median home value is $230,000 per year.\n\n### #9 - Memphis\nDespite having a population of over 650,000 people, Memphis still very much feels like a small country town. Situated on the great Mississippi River, Memphis has a unique character that cannot be duplicated in any other city on our list. There are plenty of activities to do inside of the city, or if you're looking for a more laid back lifestyle in your retirement years, the suburbs of Memphis and neighboring communities make for a great place to call home. The median home value is on the low end, so you'll really be able to stretch your retirement dollar here!\n\n### #8 - Murfreesboro\nWell known for its American Civil War History, Murfreesboro makes our list at spot number eight. The affordable median home price of $250,000, and affordable tax rates, make this area a great place for retirees to live. Retired residents can enjoy playing golf at the Old Fort Golf Club, or relax at one of the beautiful outdoor parks. The large Middle Tennessee State University campus keeps the city young at heart, and you'll enjoy plenty of entertainment, shows, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Murfreesboro.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Knoxville\nSituated just an hour north of the great smoky mountains national park, and home to the legendary University of Tennessee college football team, Knoxville surely makes our list of best places to retire in Tennessee. The city of Knoxville is located in East Tennessee and is nearly 1/4 the size of Memphis with a population of 180,000 people. Housing is rather affordable with the average home price being $215,000.\n\n### #6 - Nashville\nLocated in Davidson County, Nashville has our heart and is arguably the gem of Tennessee. There's no question Nashville makes our list of best places to retire. The residents here not only enjoy an international airport which makes traveling convenient, but they are also spoiled with amazing food choices, an endless amount of live entertainment, over 100 parks, and plenty of social clubs and recreation activities all across the city. Between the art scene, and the birthplace of country music, this is undoubtedly amongst the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-nashville-tennessee)**\n\n### #5 - Oak Hill\nAlthough this area is more expensive than other areas of Tennessee, Oak Hill is attracting more and more retirees. This is far enough outside of Nashville if you're seeking a laid back lifestyle, but just a short drive into the city where you can enjoy tons of shows, plays, concerts, restaurants, and museums.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like living in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-oak-hill-in-nashville)**\n\n### #4 - Pigeon Forge / Gatlinburg\nJust 40 minutes west of the North Carolina border sits Pigeon Forge. We promise, there is nothing more satisfying than having your morning coffee on your back deck overlooking the natural beauty of the great smoky mountains. No matter the season, the smoky mountains of Tennessee will always be a magnificent sight to see. Pigeon Forge is a small town that is well known for its amazing retirement benefits. The low cost of living, pretty views, and ease of access in and out of larger cities, makes this one of the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n### #3 - Franklin\nWhy is Franklin one of the best places to retire in Tennessee? Franklin is not only a historically rich town, it's also an affluent town. The active downtown surely promises a great culture. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, museums, and a fantastic music culture, Franklin is nothing shy of an amazing place to be. Your life can be as active as you'd like. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from. From walking trails, various parks, and several public golf courses, it's no secret why the population is on the rise!\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our Franklin neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Kingston Springs\nKingston Springs is a beautiful town located in Cheatham County just 20 miles southwest of the big city (Downtown Nashville). The population is shy of 6,000 residents. Residents of Kingston Springs love the several outdoor adventures this rural town provides. Between hiking, fishing in the river, golf, or canoeing, you won't be bored here. Kingston Springs is an incredibly safe place to be with a very low crime rate. Better yet, if the outdoor activities do not keep you busy, you can drive 25 minutes to Downtown Nashville and enjoy all this large metropolitan city has to offer. Most homes in Cheatham County are on over an acre of land so Kingston Springs is our pick for retirees who prefer some privacy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)**\n\n### #1 - Tellico Lake\nThe Tellico Lake community tops our list as the best place to retire and for good reason. Anywhere along Tellico Lake is nothing shy of a dream. The lake is 33 miles long and provides over 357 miles of beautiful shoreline. Entertainment and recreation activities are endless. Between boating, fishing, golfing, hiking, and walking trails, you'll love spending your life on the lake! Roughly an hour drive to the smoky mountains and half an hour away from Knoxville, Tellico Lake provides the best of both worlds.\n\n## Areas To Avoid\nNow that we covered the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee, what are some places you should avoid?\n\n### Davidson County\nWhile the city of Nashville is located in Davidson County, if you're looking to avoid rising property taxes in your retirement years, we would suggest looking for homes outside of county limits. If you're able to put up with [higher property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike), Davidson County has a lot to offer.\n\n### Dyersburg\nDyersburg is one of the cities we'd recommend you avoid. With a population of roughly 17,000, it's surprising how high the crime rate is compared to the national average. The city has struggled to expand and develop over the years. It's located on the west end of Tennessee, and hours away from vibrant, culturally rich, cities.\n\n### Jackson\n70 miles east of Memphis is Jackson Tennessee. Unfortunately, Jackson makes the top 100 most dangerous cities in America list. Much of the city has a household income below the poverty line.\n\n## Looking To Retire In Tennessee?\nIf you're looking to retire in Tennessee, we're here to help.

On their way home, they often find themselves thinking they should just move to Tennessee for good. But it's a big decision that we don't take lightly, which is why we've put together your all-inclusive guide to The Volunteer State complete with a list of pros and cons, [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) statistics, and the [best places to live](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee). It'll help you decide if moving to Tennessee should be your next adventure, and provide insight into the best spots to call home.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Major Cities In Tennessee?\n\nTennesseans aren't ones to brag, but they have more than their fair share of cities to be proud of. Unlike towns in some other areas of the U.S., each of the state's population centers has its own distinct character, landscape, and appeal. From Memphis along the Mississippi to Knoxville in the Appalachians, Tennessee offers a nearly unparalleled combination of unique cities.\n\n### Nashville\n\n![Image of two girls standing in front of a mural in Nashville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Nashville_mural_e93790fb88.jpg)\n\nThere are a number of reasons that [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville) headlines Tennessee's urban lineup. The capital city is right in the middle of the state and has the highest metro population, of nearly 2 million residents. It's not just the hub of Tennessee, but also one of the Southeast's cultural centerpieces. The nightlife, whether on Broadway, at Five Points, or any of the city's other social hotspots, is unparalleled. Apart from that, Nashville's collection of colleges (including Vanderbilt University), and historical icons like the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium, lend the city a nearly endless inventory of attractions. Perhaps that's why it's one of the fastest-growing cities in the entire U.S. If you're thinking about [moving to Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-nashville) specifically, check our guide on what makes the music city a great place.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our picks for the top 10 suburbs in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-suburbs-of-nashville-real-estate)**\n\n### Knoxville\n\nThis valley town, nestled between the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, has been a nucleus of Appalachian life for generations. From its location along the Tennessee River, a town that began as a clearinghouse for the mountains' natural resources, evolved into a regional center for tourism and Appalachian culture. Today it's home to the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, the state's flagship university, and many landmarks, like the Tennessee Theatre and the \"Sunsphere\" from the 1982 World's Fair. And even though the fair may have left town, Knoxville remains one of Tennessee's great destinations.\n\n### Memphis\n\n![Image of a man and a woman standing in front of a sign that says the words \"Memphis\"](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/moving_to_tennessee_1_da2e4d1156_b8def6d923.jpg)\n\nNashville may have the shiniest music scene, but Memphis, along the banks of the Mississippi River, will always be the ancestral home of the blues. The neon lights of Beale Street still illuminate live music played in the same places where names like Elvis, Cash, and Aretha got their start. To this day, millions of Elvis Presley's admirers make their way to Graceland, his mansion, to pay tribute to The King of Rock N' Roll. Yet, Memphis is about more than just music. FedEx calls the city home, thus continuing Memphis's long-standing reputation as a transportation hub. And the National Civil Rights Museum is also there, in recognition of the town's tragic past (Memphis is the site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination) and hopeful future. Plus, you will never go hungry with the food scene and bbq around town.\n\n### Chattanooga\n\nChattanooga is a smaller city that sits on the state border of Georgia and Tennessee. This railroad town has always been notable for its contributions to the Southern manufacturing economy and its key role in the Civil War, but lately, it has also evolved into a haven for tourism. Destinations like Ruby Falls, Rock City (have you seen it?), and the Tennessee Aquarium make Chattanooga one of the best visits in the state. It also doesn't hurt that its position along the Tennessee River, right at the foot of the Appalachians, is about as picturesque as it gets. Since the TVA created a reservoir system to keep the valley from flooding, Chattanooga has been able to develop into a city worthy of its beautiful location.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The History Of Tennessee?\n\nTennessee started out as part of North Carolina but gained statehood in 1796. It didn't get its nickname, \"The Volunteer State\", until the War of 1812, when droves of the state's residents fought to defend the young United States. This sense of duty continued during the Mexican-American War and the Civil War when Tennessee had the paradoxical distinction of supplying the most Confederate and Union regiments of any Confederate state. Tennessee has historically been known for its diverse natural resources and economic landscape. Until the early 1900s, when railroad development rendered steamboats mostly obsolete, Memphis was the premier stop along the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the eastern part of the state was functioning as a hub for marble, iron, coal, and other natural resources provided by the mountains. During the Great Depression, when the TVA started turning Tennessee into the nation's largest supplier of public utilities, the state really started to take off economically. The Manhattan Project even created a research facility in the state that used the ample power for missile development. Alongside all this, Tennessee gained a reputation as an artistic and travel hub that is still drawing many visitors today.\n\n## What Is Tennessee Know For?\n\nTennessee's reputation, frankly, defies summarization. It's a music-loving, football-crazy, history-filled state with more attractions and features than one could see in a lifetime. Its system of rivers and lakes rivals any in the country, and its mountains boast some of the highest peaks east of the Rockies. On top of that, four distinct cities each provide a different way to experience the state. However, if we have to choose, Tennessee is probably most notable for...\n\n### The Smoky Mountains\n\nSince The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established in 1934, it has put Tennessee on the map as a place of accessible natural beauty. The Appalachian Trail runs right through the park along the TN-NC border and offers just a taste of the unbelievable hiking the area has to offer. It's the most-visited national park in the country, and the state has done a wonderful job complementing the natural world with some beloved entertainment options. Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge are both prime mountain tourist destinations just outside the park's borders. Gatlinburg is essentially a carnival in the Appalachians, with its own aquarium, huge ropes courses, and SkyBridge, the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in North America. Pigeon Forge, its neighbor and tourism rival, has its own long list of attractions headlined by Dollywood, the theme park based on the state's own Dolly Parton.\n\n### Country Music\n\n![Image of people standing inside the country music hall of fame located in downtown Nashville](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HOF_6fc8fe9dc8.jpg)\n\nTennessee may be the home of the Blues, but country music defines its reputation today. Some of the earliest country music, with its signature fiddle, came out of the state's mountains. Now, the genre calls Nashville home. Dozens of stars, like Taylor Swift (we still count her!), Jason Isbell, and Chris Stapleton, reside in and around Nashville, with more moving in every day. The Ryman Auditorium, the Bluebird Cafe, and the Grand Ole Opry are just a few of the signature spots for live shows. With modern venues like the Ascend Amphitheater and the Country Music Hall of Fame popping up seemingly every year, country music isn't finding a new home any time soon.\n\n## How's The Cost Of Living In Tennessee?\n\nLike any large area, the [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) will vary based on the city. In general, though, Tennessee is quite reasonable compared to most of the country. \n\n### Which parts of Tennessee have a low cost of living?\n\nIn general, your dollar goes further in smaller towns. In fact, eight Tennessee towns rank in the top 100 for [best places to relocate to](https://www.movebuddha.com/blog/popular-small-city-list/). When there are fewer residents and more space, housing costs tend to be lower. That's why places like Johnson City and Clarksville boast living costs well below the national average and have positioned themselves as pleasant, inexpensive places to live. Lucky for Tennessee, even more-populated areas are still very affordable. Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis, for instance, are relatively cheap mainly because of their reasonable housing costs. This makes Tennessee one of the rare states where you can get cosmopolitan living without high-end prices.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See The Top 10 Most Affordable Nashville Suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs)**\n\n### Which parts of Tennessee have a high cost of living?\n\nJust about the only locale in Tennessee where the cost of living slides above the national average is Nashville. This isn't some huge surprise. Nashville has some of the nicest neighborhoods and homes in the entire country, with entertainment and amenities to match. Considering everything it has to offer, it's remarkable that the Nashville-metro area's overall living costs are just barely higher than the national average. More affordable communities outside Nashville, like Murfreesboro, make living in Nashville more attainable.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See The 20 Most Exclusive Neighborhoods In Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-nashville)**\n\n## How's The Economy In Tennessee?\n\nTennessee's economy was in the midst of an unprecedented upswing when the pandemic hit. The unemployment rate was at a record-low 3.3%, corporations were flourishing, and tourism was thriving. Even as those economic indicators take a hit, though, Tennessee's economy has still gracefully withstood the pressures of 2020. The state's unemployment is around 5%, and job creation has continued. Many aspects of life over the past 12 months may have changed, but Tennessee's overall economic outlook has remained strong.\n\n### What are the pros of Tennessee's economy?\n\nCorporations are catching on to Tennessee for its favorable labor laws and exceptionally low state tax rates (including no state income tax!). A range of companies, including FedEx, International Paper, Dollar General, and Cracker Barrel have made the state their headquarters. Many more, like Tyson Chicken and Nissan, operate massive plants and other facilities within the state's borders. Besides its reputation as a corporate haven, Tennessee also draws millions of visitors every year. Nashville, Memphis, and the mountains combine to create a statewide swath of tourist attractions that draw lots of money into the state's borders.\n\n### What are the cons of Tennessee's economy?\n\nLike everywhere, Tennessee's small towns have seen their fair share of decay as money and talent clusters in the more urban areas. Out of all the state's big cities, Knoxville has shown limited job growth. While this may be a little troubling, the university and consistent tourism still give Knoxville a favorable economic floor.\n\n### How's the job market in Tennessee?\n\nThough Tennessee lags behind other parts of the country with average wages, you are likely not to notice due to the low cost of living. Major cities in Tennessee have large companies that bring many jobs. In Middle Tennessee, these include huge healthcare companies like HCA, Community Health Systems, Vanderbilt, and Saint Thomas. Other big players in Nashville include Nissan, Vanderbilt University, Asurion, and Amazon. Outside of Nashville, major employers also include Fed- Ex in Memphis and Oak Ridge Labratory in Knoxville.\n\n## How Are The Schools In Tennessee?\n\n### Top school districts in Tennessee\n\nConsidering Tennessee's diversity and size, the state maintains an impressive system of public education. Germantown, a suburb of Memphis, is considered the best overall school district, while just outside Knoxville, Maryville takes the second-place spot. The Arlington and Kingsport school districts are also top-notch, and various [Nashville suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts), like [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin), [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), and [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), have outstanding public and private schools. Franklin, Brentwood, Nolensville, and Spring Hill are all in Williamson County.\n\n### Top public schools in Tennessee\n\nThe state's best public high schools tend to belong to big city suburbs, particularly the ones that surround Nashville. US News ranks Merrol Hyde Magnet School in [Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville), a suburb of Nashville, as the top high school in the state and a top-three school in the entire nation. High schools in and around Nashville take the first seven spots in the rankings, followed closely by specialized high schools from other areas, like Knoxville's L\u0026N Stem Academy.\n\n### Top private schools in Tennessee\n\nMost private schools are clustered around Memphis and Nashville, but nearly every major metropolitan area offers a great private school option for your child's education. According to Niche.com, the University School of Nashville and Memphis's St. Mary's Episcopal School receive the top marks. Chattanooga's Baylor School and the Webb School of Knoxville are great options in the state's slightly smaller locales. If you're looking at boarding school options, McCallie School just outside of Chattanooga is also a famous institution for all-boys education.\n\n## How Is The Real Estate Market In Tennessee?\n\nIt may have been a difficult year for the overall economy, but that hasn't stopped [Tennessee's booming real estate market](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-real-estate-market-update). People attracted by Tennessee's forgiving taxes, affordable living costs, and ample space are fleeing other states, and their presence is helping to drive the market higher across the boards. Every major metropolitan area has seen a considerable increase in average sale prices over the last year, and even smaller towns are starting to show nice upticks in home prices.\n\n### Are homes expensive in Tennessee?\n\nIn most towns, inexpensive homes are the primary reason that the state maintains such an accessible economic threshold for living. Home values in areas like Knoxville or Chattanooga, even though they've lately been rising, are still some of the best you'll find in a city. Many people find suitable homes for around, or even under, $200K. Those who move to Tennessee might be a little less thrilled by the 'big city' Nashville market, where average home prices hover just under $350K, with numerous areas reaching values considerably higher than that. This may not be music to your ears, especially if you're considering a move, but there's simply not a more desirable area in the state. Also, Nashville home values have consistently increased over the years, so despite the price, it remains a good investment.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See Nashville homes for sale](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville)**\n\n### How much are property taxes in Tennessee?\n\nTennessee's property taxes are famously low. Residents usually pay around half as much in property taxes per year as the average United States citizen. Exact property tax rates depend on the county (0.5% of the assessed value is a good estimate), but regardless of the location, property taxes make moving to Tennessee a particularly promising proposition.\n\n## Moving To Tennessee Pros And Cons\n\nOver the last 20 years, Tennessee has enjoyed an impressive rate of population growth. Low tax rates, living costs, and high quality of life have kept people on the move to Tennessee. It's not a perfect place, but for the price, Tennessee is about as good as one can get.\n\n### Top 5 Pros to moving to Tennessee\n\n#### **Low property taxes**\n\nWe'll say it again: Tennessee has one of the lowest property tax rates in the country, which makes it one of the best states to own property. If you plan on staying for a while, Tennessee's property tax policy will keep money in your pocket for years to come.\n\n#### **No state income tax**\n\nThat's right, there's no state income tax, so you get to keep as much of what you earn as possible. That's why your income goes as far in Tennessee as just about any other area in the country. The state compensates for this income tax break with a higher-than-average sales tax (around 7%). This ensures that Tennessee's visitors help the residents cover a large chunk of their living costs.\n\n#### **Low cost of living**\n\nLow taxes tend to mean low living expenses as well. Between this favorable tax structure and reasonable real estate prices, the result is a place where you know your income and savings work hard for you. Wherever you're living in Tennessee, chances are your daily expenses are well below the national average. And even if you're looking to move to Nashville, you won't be paying much more than the average American.\n\n#### **Tennessee mountains and lakes**\n\nTennessee is home to dozens of large and beautiful lakes, some of which are situated close to urban areas. The Nashville suburbs, for instance, are home to Old Hickory Lake and the Percy Priest Reservoir. While these lakes are distributed across the state, a multitude of them is nestled amongst the beautiful Appalachian Mountains, where multiple peaks rise well over 6,000 feet. These offer some of the best hiking and scenery in the entire United States. It's all the perfect place for a boating enthusiast.\n\n#### **Mild climate**\n\nTennessee's climate is one of the most comfortable in the country. Although average temperatures rise as you move farther west toward the Mississippi River, the entire state enjoys cool winters and long, warm summers. Most places, and especially the mountains, get the occasional snow and ice storm, but spring generally arrives quickly once March comes around.\n\n### Top 5 Cons to moving to Tennessee\n\n#### **Country music (unless you're a fan!)**\n\nCountry music is just a given in most parts of Tennessee. Live music is everywhere from hotels to bars to parks, and this isn't changing any time soon. If country music is what you want, then you're in the right place! Those who aren't fans of the genre, though, might not be so thrilled about the state's preferred soundtrack.\n\n#### **Cost of living is rising**\n\nTennessee's [cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee) is incredibly low, but it may not always stay that way. A few desirable areas, like Nashville, are slowly becoming more expensive. In fact, [Davidson County's property taxes increased 34% recently](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike). That said, most areas are unlikely to break your bank, but if you're looking to save money it's best to avoid the trendiest spots.\n\n#### **Landlocked state**\n\nIf you're all about coastal living or you have a \"Salt Life\" sticker on the back of your car, then Tennessee might not be what you're looking for. Tennessee may have its fair share of rivers and lakes although it's hours from sandy ocean beaches.\n\n#### **Humid climate**\n\nLet's just say that the term \"dry heat\" isn't something a lot of Tennesseans are familiar with. Tennessee's relative humidity is around 70%, which is middle of the pack within the U.S. However, combine that humidity rate with Southeastern summers and, well, it's not most people's idea of comfort. Luckily, those summers are still fairly mild for the Southeast, and over the years you'll appreciate how the extra moisture in the air keeps the drought risk minimal.\n\n#### **Slow to change**\n\nWe don't need to go through all the stereotypes, but generally, southern states has a tendency to move a little slower. This is sometimes a good thing, like when it comes to tinkering with your favorite hot chicken recipe. Sometimes though, it can be frustrating. New ideas take time to find a cultural foothold, whether they're as important as creating a more inclusive society, or as trivial as wishing you had a closer Chipotle. In fact, Tennessee is one of only ten states in the country where it is illegal for a real estate buyer's agent to offer their client a commission rebate ([although Felix Homes has a way around this](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee)). That doesn't mean, however, that Tennessee isn't trying to get with the times. Especially in urban areas, new types of people are coming to stay and bringing a fresh perspective with them. Tennessee is as open to change as ever and becoming more flexible in meeting every need...just don't mess with the hot chicken recipe.\n\n## Is Moving To Tennessee A Good Idea?\n\nWe don't know if [living in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) is your next step, but plenty of people have answered this question with a resounding yes! Job prospects are great, living costs are limited, and you'll never run out of things to do. Visitors often come for a weekend and realize immediately after leaving that they want to make Tennessee their home.\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for young professionals?\n\nIt's no secret what young professionals are looking for: nightlife, restaurants, convenience, and plenty of other young people to get to know. There are neighborhoods in cities like Chattanooga and Memphis that cater to this demographic, but for the [ultimate young professional lifestyle](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals), nothing compares to Nashville. The city's unparalleled neighborhood bar scene means that you don't have to venture downtown for a good night out, and plenty of chic rental properties make for accessible urban living. Then, if you want to hit the music and bar scene downtown, it's an easy 5 minute Uber ride. [The Nations](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-nations), [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills), [Germantown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/germantown), [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville), and [The Gulch](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-gulch) are just a few entries on the extensive list of convenient neighborhoods. Or you could just live [downtown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) with all the action right outside your window.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's The Top 6 Nashville Neighborhoods for Singles \u0026 Young Professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals)**\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for families?\n\nWe hate to keep going back to the old standby, but yet again we have to give the nod to [Nashville's Suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-suburbs-of-nashville-real-estate). It simply offers the most enticing combination of location, activities, schools, and properties. The best part is, there's a suburb for every budget. Neighborhoods like [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills), [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), and [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) are some of the best communities in the Southeast but can be prohibitively expensive. Luckily, areas like [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), and [Mount Juliet](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/mount-juliet) offer plenty of family-friendly features in a more affordable real estate market. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out the best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### Where is the best place to live in Tennessee for retirees?\n\nThere are plenty of areas in Tennessee where retirees can stretch their dollars without sacrificing space and amenities. Which one you choose depends on the retirement lifestyle you would like to pursue. If you'd like to while away the years in the mountains, we suggest communities along Tellico Lake just south of Knoxville. Plenty of nice shorelines, large lots, and forgiving tax laws will keep you as comfortable as possible. For more urban-centric retirees, [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) really can't be beaten. Living costs are high, but it's a cultural hub with an astonishing restaurant and arts scene that certainly never gets old.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our top 10 places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee)**\n\n### Should you move from California to Tennessee?\n\nThat depends. New residents are coming from California every day. The factors pushing them to Tennessee are lower cost of living, less traffic, and shorter commutes. If that's appealing, a new Tennessee home may be for you. There are some downsides for Californians moving to Tennessee: tornadoes, no oceans, and a challenging market for buyers in many of Tennessee's most desirable areas.\n\n## Is Tennessee A Safe Place?\n\nNo area is perfectly safe, but we have to admit that some are safer than others, and perhaps no other factor is more important when considering where to move. Fortunately, Tennessee offers plenty of low-risk residential options that will tax your nerves about as much as they'll tax your income (a.k.a not at all).\n\n### What are the safest places to live in Tennessee?\n\nFrom a safety perspective, you can't go wrong with Nashville's premier suburbs. [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill), and [Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs) are all havens situated around Tennessee's largest city. If you're thinking you'd like to go rural, though, then you'll have to see the vast tracts available in [Watertown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/watertown), just 40 miles East of Nashville. In the town of 1,700, crime is almost nonexistent.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our list of safest places to live in Tennessee in 2025](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### What are the most dangerous places to live in Tennessee?\n\nJust because you want to move to Tennessee doesn't mean there aren't places in the state you'd rather not live. Over the years, Memphis has developed a less-than-pleasant safety reputation. Unfortunately, it keeps proving that the rumors are true. There are safe places to live around Memphis, like Collierville and Germantown, but overall, Memphis sees considerably more violent crimes than any other location in Tennessee.\n\n## Conclusion–Should You Move To Tennessee?\n\nWell, it's time to deliver the verdict, and it looks like you should seriously consider moving to The Volunteer State. Living in Tennessee may not be for everyone, but if we're talking pros and cons, the advantages are staggering. Between the low cost of living, natural beauty, and endless activities, there has never been a better time to call the state home.\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is where five-star service meets low commissions!

Tennessee’s top LGBT areas offer Southern hospitality with a little extra glitter thrown in.\n\nIf you’re looking for LGBT culture, events, businesses, and more, you’ll find some. Throughout the state in big cities, smaller towns, and everything in between, you will find a welcoming place to call “home” or looking to meet like-minded people in your area. We’ve put together a list of the 9 most LGBT-friendly places to live in Tennessee. So, prepare to get vibrant, be out and proud, and have fun in one of these Tennessee locales.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## How To Determine If A Neighborhood Is LGBT Friendly\n\nWhen you’re in an LGBT-friendly neighborhood, you feel the warm hug of welcomeness. However, identifying a gay-friendly locale from the outside may not be as easy. In order to create our list of the most friendly, inclusive, and open places for LGBT individuals to live, we looked at pride events, gay-friendly businesses, LGBT non-profits, and LGBT organizations. We even chatted with locals.\n\n## Nashville\n\nThere’s no need for [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville) to come out as gay-friendly. This hotbed of art and music has been a hub for queer communities in Tennessee for decades. While many people refer to Nashville as the “buckle of the Bible Belt,” others have renamed it “[A shining liberal buckle on the tired Bible Belt](https://queerintheworld.com/gay-nashville-tennessee-travel-guide/).” This is because Nashville has an extensive liberal and progressive population.\n\nWith more fun and culture than most new residents can experience in under a year, you likely won’t be surprised that Nashville offers many unique gay experiences such as Suzy Wong’s House of Yum and Cafe Coco.\n\nNashville even has its own gay publication, Out \u0026 About, which you will find at all the local libraries. Nashville also hosts an elaborate and exciting pride parade and pride festival each year. And Music City also has a wide array of smaller [gay pride events](https://www.nashvillepride.org/new-events) throughout the year. \n\nMany of the area’s gay and straight residents volunteer and support the many non-profits in the area that support struggling gay youth and other queer people in need of a helping hand. PFLAG, Nashville CARES, and Oasis are the most well-known in the area.\n\n### What neighborhoods in Nashville are the most gay-friendly?\n- [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville)\n- [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills)\n- [12 South](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/12-south)\n- [West End](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/hillsboro-west-end)\n- [The Nations](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-nations)\n- [Hillsboro Village](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/hillsboro-belmont)\n\n\n## Memphis\n\nMemphis is a haven for Tennessee's LGBT population. This expansive city embraces both art and its residents, no matter how they identify. And they’re ready to step up and help LBGT youth, trans people, and other LGBT people. In fact, Memphis has the [highest number of LGBT non-profits](https://www.causeiq.com/directory/lgbt-rights-organizations-list/tennessee-state/) in Tennessee. \n\nMemphis is home to many gay bars in and around its downtown center in the Midtown area. Here you will find a Wrangler’s-and-cowboy-boots aesthetic, but you don’t have to wear spurs to have fun. The Pumping Station and DRUS Bar are some of the most happening places for LGBT nightlife. \n\nLike Nashville, Memphis has a widely circulated LGBT publication, Focus Mid-South, which keeps the community up on the latest events and happenings. The Memphis Gaydar is also a fun way to stay apprised with gay news, events, and more in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nThis historic city has one of the most prominent LGBT community theater organizations, [Friends of George’s](https://www.friendsofgeorges.org/).  Memphis also hosts the [Mid-South Pride Festival](https://midsouthpride.org/), which always attracts a massive turnout.\n\n[OUTMemphis](https://www.outmemphis.org/) is an exceptionally effective and large non-profit that centers its energy and efforts on helping all LGBT people in the Memphis area. They are a resource for the community and cultural events along with health and wellness and preventing homelessness.\n\n## Knoxville\n\nKnoxville exclaims its inclusivity with the motto: Y’all Means ALL. And Knoxville came in at number eight for the gayest cities in American according to *[Advocate](https://www.advocate.com/travel/2012/01/09/gayest-cities-america-2012?pg=7#article-content)* in 2012. \n\nAs a university town, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Knoxville remains committed to pushing equality and investing in the arts while protecting the civil liberties of its LGBT residents. It’s not uncommon to stumble across a march downtown in support of LGBT rights or other forms of activism. If you’re in the area, you have to check out [Keep Knox Queer](https://www.facebook.com/groups/keepknoxqueer/) or one of the other [major gay pride events](https://knoxpride.com/) hosted in the city. In fact, Knoxville’s 2018 Pride Festival helped the city set the record for the largest Pride Fest in Tennessee.\n\nThis medium-sized city has a sizable queer population with businesses to boot. In fact, Knoxville rivals Memphis in its number of gay bars, despite being about half the size. The Edge and Club XYZ are two local favorites when it comes to letting your hair down and having a drink in a gay-friendly bar.\n\nOther highlights that make Knoxville a great place to be out and proud include that it was one of the first cities in the south and the first in Tennessee to have an LGBT liaison for the Knoxville Police Department and the Mayor’s administration. There are also many LGBT rights non-profit organizations in Knoxville, including Knox Pride. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Chattanooga\n\nWe let the cat out of the bag with this one. While many people drive through Chattanooga on their way from Atlanta to Nashville, few stop. And far fewer LGBT people stop. This may be because of the ominous crosses you’ll see as you travel I-24, but we are pleased to say that Chatanooga is a hidden gem when it comes to gay culture and acceptance.\n\nThroughout Chatanooga, you will find self-identified gay-friendly neighborhoods. The most notable of these is the North Shore district where diversity is queen, and neighbors are neighborly, no matter your color, creed, or identity.\n\nNot only does Chattanooga offer small-town charm, but it also has an abundant array of places to enjoy the arts and culture. For some nightlife, many local LGBT people head to Alan’s Gold Discotheque or Backstage Bar.\n\nWhat about those crosses? Yes, Chattanooga is part of the Bible Belt, but many churches are open and affirming of gay members in their congregations. [New Covenant Church](http://www.newcovenantchattanooga.com/) is one of the most popular among gay Christians.\n\nChattanooga has its own exciting and lively annual [Pride Parade](https://www.chattanoogapride.com/) and many other [Pride events](https://www.facebook.com/TennesseeValleyPride/) throughout the year. This city also has its own chapter of [PFLAG](https://pflag.org/chapter/pflag-chattanooga).\n\nIf you want to live in a gay-friendly city with unlimited outdoor activities, you cannot beat Chatanooga.\n\n## Johnson City\n\nTucked into the northeast corner of Tennessee, you will find Johnson City. This small town may only have about 65,000 residents, but it is the ninth biggest city in the state and one of the warmest when it comes to LGBT neighborliness. \n\nWhat makes this city such a gay-friendly anomaly for a small Southern town? Its gay-friendly atmosphere may be due to its four colleges and universities, or it may just be that residents of Johnson City just tend to embrace everyone with open arms. Either way, this quaint, quiet, and picturesque town is a great place to be out and proud.\n\nJohnson City just started hosting a Pride Fest, but their very first one attracted happy participants from all over. In fact, over 10,000 people showed up for the [inaugural Johnson City Pride Parade and Festival](https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/10000-celebrate-inaugural-tri-pride-festival-in-johnson-city/)–That’s one-sixth of the city’s population.\n\nAs for gay nightlife, the New Beginnings and The Crow Bar are two local favorites. And this lovely city has the [fifth largest population of LGBT people](https://heraldcourier.com/news/johnson-city-fifth-in-state-when-it-comes-to-same-sex-couples/article_93df4a8d-51d3-522a-858f-0d810f9b3570.html) in the state according to the 2010 census.\n\nAs for non-profits, you will find the [Pride Community Center of the Tri-Cities](http://pridetricities.com/), which continually increases the visibility of the gay community and advocates for gay rights. They also support gay youth in need and bring attention to gay-owned businesses.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a close-knit community away from the hustle and bustle, which also embraces LGBT people, it is difficult to beat Johnson City in Tennessee.\n\n## Jackson\n\nHalfway between Nashville and Memphis, you will find Jackson, Tennessee, a small city that is wholeheartedly committed to providing all residents with the best. Similar in size to Johnson City with just under 70,000 residents, Jackson has made large strides toward inclusivity. \n\n[Equality Jackson](https://equalityjacksontn.org/resources/) has been a driving force in increasing LGBT visibility. They also assist LGBT people in crisis, help connect LGBT people with gay-friendly churches, and organize events. [Out Jackson](https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/life/style/jackson-life/2017/05/05/lgbtq-launches-jackson/101288242/) is an organization that has encouraged LGBT people to be open about their identities to reduce the stigma and normalize being gay. \n\nAs far as community atmosphere, most people would describe living in Jackson as like living in Mayberry. This may scare some LGBT people given the idea that most small towns are not accepting of LGBT people. However, neighbors in Jackson welcome others with open arms, and much of the city has participated in the “I love Jackson and I support LGBTQ equality” campaign. The purpose of the campaign has been to break the stereotype that small towns are homophobic. And, so far, it’s been a huge success.\n\n## Gatlinburg \u0026 Pigeon Forge\n\nWhen it comes to the small resort towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, many queer folks feel quite welcome and content. Just a stone’s throw from Dollywood and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, these relaxed and hippie-like towns are known for prioritizing creating an inviting atmosphere for all. \n\nWhile you won’t find many gay nightclubs or bars in the area, you will find many gay-friendly accommodations and businesses galore. With events like [Gay Day at Dollywood](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/gay-day-at-dollywood-brings-red-shirts-to-smoky-mtns/), we anticipate more and more visibility for LGBT people in the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area.\n\nDolly Parton plays a major role in the Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg communities. She donated quite a bit of money for relief after the Gatlinburg Fires, and because Dollywood has been a major contributor to the local economy most locals pay her a lot of respect. As a major advocate for equality in Tennesee and gay icon, Dolly Parton’s attitude has spread throughout these small towns. And most residents offer a warm welcome to gay people.\n\n## Brentwood \u0026 Franklin\n\n[Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) and [Brentwood, Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood) are located just south of Nashville. And just as South Nashville bleeds into Brentwood, so do the forward-thinking and LGBT-positive attitudes. While these cities do not have quite as large of a network of gay organizations, they do have residents with positive attitudes and many places of worship that are happy to invite LGBT people into their congregations. \n\nFranklin does host its own [Pride Fest](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2020/01/28/franklin-tn-pride-2020-franklin-theatre/4598087002/) and has its own [PFLAG organization](https://www.facebook.com/PFLAGFranklinTN/). Many gay residents of the area drive north to Nashville for fun nights out at bars such as [Trax](https://www.facebook.com/traxnashville). They also join Nashville LGBT organizations to promote and expand visibility and equality throughout the Middle Tennessee region.\n\n## Clarksville\n\nAbout an hour northwest of Nashville, you will find the fifth biggest city in Tennessee, [Clarksville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/clarksville). This small city is home to Austin Peay State University and borders Fort Campbell. These institutions can feel like opposing forces when it comes to acceptance, at times. And the city still seems to be in flux when it comes to progressive attitudes regarding LGBT rights. However, Clarksville is headed in the right direction.\n\nClarksville has its own [Pride Fest](https://clarksvillenow.com/local/new-lgbt-group-forms-to-support-equality-local-pride-march/) and an active group of advocates that run [Equality Clarksville](https://www.facebook.com/equalityclarksville/). As far as nightlife, many gay Clarksville residents make the trek to Nashville where there are plenty of gay bars to choose from.\n\nIn response to a recent [national survey](https://clarksvillenow.com/local/clarksville-dinged-on-lgbtq-equality-in-new-report-updates-discrimination-policy/) that rated cities based on their LGBTQ equality, Clarksville has recommitted energy and funds to improve the city for queer people. Community leaders have been vocal about their support of the Clarksville LGBT community and want their LGBTQ neighbors to feel welcome.\n\n## Our Final Thoughts\n\nLGBT communities offer welcoming, open, often artistic settings for LGBT families, young professionals, couples, and individuals. If you’re moving to Tennessee and wondering where you can find acceptance and celebration of your LGBT lifestyle, any of these cities would be a great choice. \n\nNeed help navigating LGBT neighborhoods to find your next home in Tennessee?

You may be surprised which cities rank as the wealthiest.\n\n[**PRO TIP: Has living in Tennessee been on your mind? Check out our local guide to living in The Volunteer State.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Methodology\n\nHow did we decide which cities in Tennessee ranked as the richest? We used the most recent U.S. census data to determine Tennessee cities’ median household income. Since the U.S. Census lumps all residents with incomes over $250,000 per year, we also factored in the average home price, unemployment rate, highest education attained, and poverty rate. In addition to looking at income, home price, and other factors, we did account for population.\n\n## City 10: Farragut\n\n- **Median household income: $128,809**\n- **Median property value: $656,002**\n\nFarragut is nestled between Knoxville and Oak Ridge in Eastern Tennessee. This suburban city is grounded in family, outdoor living, and science. Why science? Many of the prestigious scientists that work at Oak Ridge National Lab reside in Farragut. This lovely town allows families to enjoy the perks of Knoxville’s infrastructure and culture and the University of Tennessee’s events and amenities. While this town is home to a population flush with financial means, don’t be surprised to find backyard veggie gardens, chicken coops, and clotheslines.\n\n## City 9: Collierville\n\n- **Median household income: $129,729**\n- **Median property value: $496,528**\n\nJust west, beyond Germantown, is Collierville, a city that is scenic, friendly, and steeped in financial security. Nipping at the heels of Germantown in terms of median household income, Collierville is head-and-shoulders more rural feeling than its eastern neighbor. Often voted one of the [best places to live in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/moving-to-tennessee), this high-class town has a history as rich as its residents. This city is a haven for celebrities and CEOs who like to pop over to Memphis for some barbecue and live music.\n\n## City 8: Germantown\n\n- **Median household income: $140,429**\n- **Median property value: $477,703**\n\nOn the eastern edge of Memphis, you’ll find Germantown, Tennessee. This beautiful suburb is one of the best places to call “home” in the Volunteer State. Despite being a quick drive to all the fun of Memphis, Germantown feels like a completely different country. In fact, it feels like a country with sizable yards, friendly neighbors, and plenty of places to watch the lightning bugs flutter about. This wealthy city has a wealth of parks, natural areas, and historic sights. Germantown also features a wide variety of home styles, including stately mansions, historic German-inspired architecture, and more.\n\n## City 7: Lookout Mountain\n\n- **Median household income: $135,114**\n- **Median property value: $534,500**\n\nIt’s difficult to find a better view than Lookout Mountain in all of Tennessee. Along the Georgia-Tennessee border, you’ll find this small suburb of Chattanooga that is dripping in gold. Lookout Mountain is an exclusive town nestled atop Sunset Rock National Park. While the residents may have deep pockets, the views from Rock City Mountain and the surrounding area are priceless.\n\n## City 6: College Grove\n\n- **Median household income: $155,224**\n- **Median property value: $732,800**\n\n[College Grove](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-college-grove-tennessee) is where rural charm meets modern luxury.

The area perfectly balances privacy and exclusivity with a strong sense of community.\n\nResidents enjoy sprawling estates, scenic views, and quick access to nearby hubs like Franklin and Murfreesboro.

Likely if you have, it’s because you popped down to enjoy one of the quaint restaurants or the Amish market along Nolensville Road. And while this city in [Williamson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-williamson-county-tennessee) is anything but haughty, it does have a population that out-earns the majority of the state. \n\nNolensville continues to grow as Nashville residents move south to escape the city. Since the 2010 census, [Nolensville’s population has increased by 107%](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/nolensville-tn-population), and it’s easy to understand why. This city offers peace and quiet, small-town charm, and convenience to Nashville’s most popular businesses and attractions.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville)**\n\n## City 4: Brentwood\n\n- **Median household income: $181,576**\n- **Median property value: $1,231,379**\n\n[Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-brentwood-tennessee) has been a refuge for the wealthy who want to enjoy the amenities of Nashville with a bit more home square footage and acreage.

John Overton bred thoroughbred horses, and his property remained owned by his family until nearly 1940. \n\nWhile Oak Hill is just a heartbeat away from the heart of Nashville, it is home to Radnor Park, one of Nashville’s most pristine green spaces. It’s said that many country stars and other celebrities live in and around the hills surrounding the scenic park.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the latest listings in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/oak-hill)**\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## City 2: Belle Meade\n\n- **Median household income: $220,417**\n- **Median property value: $860,000**\n\n[Belle Meade](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-belle-meade-in-nashville) exemplifies southern charm, hospitality, and grandiosity.

Before Belle Meade became home to 2,400 residents, it was home to John Harding, a southern plantation owner who invited the elite of the South to enjoy his “Belle Meade” or “beautiful meadow.” This city still has expansive yards, lush spaces, and picturesque venues that people travel from near and far to see and experience.\n\n**[PRO TIP: These listings in Belle Meade will blow you away](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/belle-meade)**\n\n## City 1: Forest Hills\n\n- **Median household income: $299,069**\n- **Median property value: $853,000**\n\n[Forest Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-forest-hills-in-nashville) is where serenity meets luxury.

We’ll also see how the metrics stack up against other popular metropolitan destinations. Lastly, we've compiled a full list of the safest neighborhoods in Nashville to further help you choose which area is best for you. \n\nThis article is specifically dedicated to neighborhoods in and around Nashville’s urban core, but if you’re curious about safety in the suburbs you can find that information [here](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee).\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn order to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information, we will be analyzing data provided by [Crime Mapping](https://www.crimemapping.com/map/tn/nashville) and the [FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)](https://www.nashville.gov/Police-Department/News-and-Reports/Crime-Statistics/Nashville-Crime-Statistics.aspx). Both sources partner with the Metro Nashville Police Department to collect and disclose crime reported in Nashville. In addition, we will leverage resources, such as [Niche](https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/nashville-davidson-tn/crime-safety/) and [Area Vibes](https://www.areavibes.com/nashville-tn/crime/), to further break down the crime occurring in Music City.\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked\n\nTo best understand Nashville’s crime statistics, let’s first take a moment to differentiate between the types of crime. The [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime) and the [state of Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/tbi/crime-issues/crime-issues/crime-statistics.html) classify crime into two main categories; violent crimes and property crimes.\n\n### Violent crimes\n\n[The National Institute of Justice (NIJ)](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crimes/violent-crime) defines a violent crime, as when a victim is harmed by or threatened with violence. The types of violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.\n\n### Property crimes\n\nA property crime occurs when a victim’s property is stolen or destroyed, without the use or threat of force against the victim. The types of property crimes include burglary, theft (larceny and motor vehicle), vandalism, and arson. \n\nCrime statistics are also relative or benchmarked against a given total number of residents. Therefore, if violent crime is ‘30 per 1,000’, this means, on average, 30 of 1,000 residents are victims of a violent crime. \n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics,  let’s get into the analysis.  \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## How Does Nashville Compare To Similar Cities\n\nAccording to [Crime Grade](https://crimegrade.org/safest-places-in-nashville-tn-metro/), Nashville’s metro area falls within the 29th percentile for safety. In simpler terms, that means 71% of other metro areas are safer, while 29% are more dangerous than Nashville. \n\nIf these numbers come as a surprise, let us clarify. As with any metropolitan location, you’ll always find some pockets with higher crime. However, that’s not to say each neighborhood is the same, or that city-living can’t be safe.  Differentiating between the good and bad areas is often apparent, but with a little bit of extra research, you’ll surely be able to determine a location’s overall safety.  \n\nWhen comparing overall crime between [100 of the largest metropolitan regions](https://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/crime3.aspx), Nashville ranks safer than Orlando, West Palm Beach, and Dallas. However, Austin, New Orleans, and Denver each hold a small safety advantage over Nashville.\n\n## What Are The Top 10 Safest Cities In The U.S.\n\n1. Hopkinton, Massachusetts\n2. Franklin, Massachusetts\n3. Buckingham Township, Pennsylvania\n4. Oakland Township, Michigan\n5. Bernards Township, New Jersey\n6. Ridgefield, Connecticut\n7. New Castle Town, New York\n8. Sparta Township, New York\n9. Hamburg Township, Michigan\n10. Bedford Town, New York\n\n\n ## What Are The Most Common Types Of Crime In Nashville\n\nAccording to the [Nashville Metro Police Department](https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Police/docs/Stats/UCR2019-2020Totals.pdf), larceny (theft) was the most common offense reported in 2020. Other prevalent types of crime include assault, vehicle break-in/theft, and burglary. Overall, the [UCR](https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Police/docs/Stats/UCR1963-2020ByPopulation.pdf) reports a higher number of property crimes per 100,000 residents when compared to the number of violent crimes in Nashville. \n\nIn total, [Area Vibes](https://www.areavibes.com/nashville-tn/crime/) notes a 1 in 20 chance of becoming a victim to some sort of crime in Nashville. However, if only considering violent crime offenses, the odds decrease to a 1 in 94 chance. Likewise, when it comes to only property crime, the chances of becoming a victim are 1 in 25.\n\n## Is Gun Violence An Issue In Nashville\n\nThe Nashville Metro Council passed a resolution that recognizes gun violence as a public health crisis. It comes after the city endured 109 homicides in 2020, the third-highest in Nashville’s history. The resolution is a step in the right direction and helps fuel many necessary conversations for improvement. \n\nIn the past year, several group marches and vigils took place around the city to shed light and honor the victims of gun violence in Nashville. In addition, the state-established group, Safe Tennessee Project, advocates as a gun violence prevention group across the state lines.\n\n## Has Crime Been Increasing Or Decreasing In Nashville Over The Past 5 Years\n\nWhen looking at crime rates in Nashville over the past 5 years, Music City reported a slight increase in overall crime each year. However, Nashville did see fewer murders and rape crimes committed. The types of crime that saw a steady yearly rise were assault and larceny - which isn’t much of a surprise considering the sheer number of tourists visiting the area. \n\nOne thing to note, if comparing the last 5 years against the early 2000s, Nashville’s crime statistics improved tremendously.\n\n## What Are Some Initiatives The City Has Implemented To Decrease The Crime Rate\n\nNashville recognizes the importance of putting an end to the growing crime rates in the city. The Metro Police Department implemented a new preventative strategy, which focuses on more resources responding to the scenes of homicides and gun violence. The police department also rolled out a “power shift”, which assigns a number of officers to work from 5 PM - 3 AM. Additionally, the city continues to fund advocacy groups, such as Metro Nashville Project Safe and The Raphah Institute, in hopes of putting an end to the city’s violence.\n\n## What Are The Safest Neighborhoods In Nashville\n\nBefore we get into the lists below, some clarification is needed. As with most metropolitan cities, you’ll find safe parts and more dangerous parts in nearly every Nashville neighborhood. This list serves as a general guide on the areas in Nashville that crime is more prevalent.

We’ll see if its stigma of high crime has any legitimacy and compare the numbers against other Nashville neighborhoods. Lastly, we’ve gathered a list of the safest and least safe communities located throughout East Nashville to help you pick which area is best for you.\n\nThe focus of the article will be around the crime rates and safety in East Nashville specifically.

As one of the largest neighborhoods in [Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville), its electric vibe is truly one of a kind. However, this location wasn’t always viewed in a great light, especially when it came to safety. In fact, even just 10 years ago, the sheer mention of East Nashville would’ve prompted a much different response than given today. \n\nThe development of East Nashville was the starting point of Nashville’s gentrification process. Over the years, much of the neighborhood had completely transformed, bringing with it new community buildings, restaurants, bars, and much more. The changes came with higher prices and sadly, pushed out some of the long-term residents. On the positive side, **the growth and development also helped to lower neighborhood crime**. \n\nEast Nashville as a whole has made huge improvements with its overall safety. Yet, some parts haven’t undergone development and are still largely impacted by high crime. This leads us to the most common concern of those wanting to move into the neighborhood, “Is East Nashville a safe place to live?” \n\n**[PRO TIP: See the latest listings in East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville)**\n\n## Methodology\n\nTo ensure we’re providing reliable and credible information, we will be referencing data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) and Crime Mapping. The two sources work in partnership with the Metro Nashville Police Department to collect and disclose reported crimes across the metropolitan region. For the purposes of this article, we’re explicitly looking into the criminal activity within the boundaries of East Nashville.\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked?\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty, let’s first review the types of crime. The FBI tracks and groups crime statistics into two main categories; violent crimes and property crime. Both metrics are important when evaluating a location’s overall safety.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Violent Crimes\n\nAccording to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime), violent crimes occur when a victim is harmed or threatened with force or violence. The types of violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. \n\n### Property Crimes\n\nThe definition of a property crime is when a victim’s property is stolen or destroyed, without the use or threat of force. This includes burglary, theft (larceny and motor vehicle), vandalism, and arson. \n\n## How Does East Nashville Compare To Other Neighborhoods In Nashville\n\nMany [neighborhoods in East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/east-nashville-neighborhoods) experienced a huge amount of development, which then improved safety. If you’re only looking at the crime levels in those developed areas, you can easily say East Nashville is safer than many other neighborhoods in Nashville. However, being that it’s the largest neighborhood in the city, not every part has fully transitioned and some still report high levels of crime.  \n\nAccording to [Area Vibes](https://www.areavibes.com/nashville-tn/most-dangerous-neighborhoods/), 8 out of the 10 most dangerous Nashville neighborhoods are not located within East Nashville. Also, the [UCR summarized by Council District](https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Police/docs/Stats/UCR2020ByCouncilDistrict.pdf), shows neighborhoods in South and [North Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-north-nashville) have a higher number of reported offenses.\n\n## What Are The Most Common Types Of Crime In East Nashville\n\n[Crime Mapping](https://www.crimemapping.com/map/tn/nashville) reports the most common type of crime reported in East Nashville is assault. Other types of prevalent crimes include larceny, vehicle break-in/theft, vandalism, and DUI. Overall, the number of property crimes is higher than the total number of violent crime offenses reported throughout East Nashville.\n\n## Is Gun Violence An Issue In East Nashville\n\nThe city of Nashville as a whole is facing concerns over the rise in gun violence. With an uptick in homicides, Nashville recognizes gun violence as a public health crisis. The [2020 homicide map](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/crime) discloses the location of each reported offense, many of which occurred in or around East Nashville.  [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/12/gun-violence-interactive-shootings-map/) also shows an interactive map of all reported shootings (fatal \u0026 nonfatal) over the last five years. The map further brings to light the issue of gun violence not only in East Nashville but throughout the city.\n\n## Has Crime Been Increasing Or Decreasing In East Nashville Over The Past 5 Years\n\nOver the past five years, East Nashville reported a continued decrease in crime. The area saw its biggest decline in violent crimes nearly 10 years ago, but murder and rape offenses continue to drop each year. Recently, there was a slight rise in East Nashville property crimes, but overall the numbers are a huge improvement. \n\n## What Are Some Initiatives The City Has Implemented To Decrease The Crime Rate\n\nEast Nashville’s gentrification and redevelopment process continue to be the number one driving force behind lowering neighborhood crime. In addition, the Metro Nashville Police Department implemented new strategies for helping reduce crime throughout the entire city. The neighborhood has a much stronger police presence than ever before, which helps to keep the East Nashville community protected and safe.\n\n## What Are The Safest Neighborhoods In East Nashville\n\n1.

Forest Hills is a town inside of Davidson County but opted out from becoming a part of the consolidated metropolitan government in Nashville. So you get your own exclusive enclave, but you still get to call Nashville home. Forest Hills has many treed lots with large homes. There are no businesses here, so you will have to head over to Nashville or Brentwood for services, stores, and restaurants. But if a big house and a big yard is your thing in Nashville, then this may be your place.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Forest Hills.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/forest-hills)\n\n### Belle Meade\n\nBelle Meade is what you think of when you hear “old money.” You will find that driving along Belle Meade Boulevard with the large historic homes and exclusive country clubs.

Perhaps the most famous of the Southeast’s iconic downtowns pulses with the energy of a Merle Haggard melody. It’s the main attraction for Nashville’s nearly 15 million visitors per year, the heart and soul of the Music City. Downtown is more than just the bars off Broadway, however. The area between I-65 and the Cumberland River, terminating at Jefferson Street, includes eight distinct neighborhoods that each provide a different taste of downtown living. Between and within these residential areas is a seemingly endless collection of cultural hotspots, historical landmarks, and event spaces.

The more and more we drive around the downtown Nashville area, the more license plates we see from all across America. People from the northeast, midwest and even southeast are flocking to Tennessee in the masses, and for good reason. The mild climate, lower cost of housing, good healthcare facilities, and pretty views of the great smoky mountains make Tennessee a [great place in terms of quality of life](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee). **But did you know Tennessee is also one of the best states for retirees?**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Why Is Tennessee A Good State For Retirees?\n\nMore and more retirees are coming to The Volunteer State to live out their golden years. Retirees find this state a great location to call home for numerous reasons.\n\n### Affordable housing and cost of living\n\nOverall, Tennessee has an [affordable cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-tennessee). The basic rules of supply and demand will apply here as well, and as more people enter the state, and very few leave, house prices are certainly expected to rise. That said, you can still get a lot of bang for your buck as the median household price is still affordable and new homes are being developed in popular cities such as Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Have you been thinking about living in Tennessee? Check out our comprehensive local guide.](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee)**\n\n### The tax rates are favorable\n\nSeldom do the words taxes and favorable go together, but in the case of Tennessee, they do! There is no [capital gains tax](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/capital-gains-tax-when-selling-a-home-in-tennessee) on your retirement income. So if you have a pension from another state, or you're living off of your 401k income, moving here will be a great way to put more money in your pocket. Who doesn't want to do that? In addition to no state income tax, the overall property tax rates are on the lower end. On average, the effective tax rate on your property is 0.74%. Although [Davidson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county), which the city of Nashville is located in just increased property taxes by 34%, they are still competitive with growing metropolitan cities like Charlotte and Atlanta. This low rate is difficult to pass up compared to other areas in the nation.\n\n### The mild climate\n\nThe northeast can see bitter cold winters and the south can be excessively hot in the summer. [Tennessee is a nice blend of both extremes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/whats-the-weather-like-living-in-tennessee). Our climate is mild. We get the beautiful 4 seasons, but our winters are not nearly as cold as our friends up north, and our summers are not as humid as the more southern states. Seeing as most retirees prefer warmer climates, this makes Tennessee a great option to consider!\n\n### Tennessee has a beautiful landscape\n\nThe beauty in Tennessee is hard to describe. There is arguably nothing prettier than having the great smoky mountains as a backdrop or [living along the hundreds of lakeshore miles](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-a-waterfront-property-in-tennessee) throughout the state. Tennessee is also known for its rolling hills and open farmland.\n\n### Our culture and history\n\nCountry music, southern hospitality, and a slower pace of life are certainly popular attributes that catch the hearts of most retirees. Our cities still have that small-town feel, but provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. The list goes on and on. There are so many reasons why people consider retiring in Tennessee. The only difficult decision is [finding the right town or city](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-tennessee) to call home!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Best Place To Retire In Tennessee?\n\nThis is one of the questions we get asked a lot at Felix Homes. There are plenty of great cities to live in, or near, picking between popular cities like Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville is nearly impossible. Instead of choosing just one, we collected our list of the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\nBefore we get into the list, if you're searching for the best [retirement communities in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-retirement-communities-tennessee), we wrote another article specifically focusing on that. But, if you're just hoping to live out your retirement years in Tennessee, and not necessarily searching for a retirement community, here is a list of our top 10 places you should considering spending your retirement years.\n\n### #10 - Chattanooga\nIf you want to embrace mother nature and all her beauty, consider moving to Chattanooga. Between the banks of the Tennessee River and Appalachian mountains, you'll be surrounded by beauty 365 days a year. Not only is Chattanooga a pretty place to call home, but it is also well known for being affordable. The median home value is $230,000 per year.\n\n### #9 - Memphis\nDespite having a population of over 650,000 people, Memphis still very much feels like a small country town. Situated on the great Mississippi River, Memphis has a unique character that cannot be duplicated in any other city on our list. There are plenty of activities to do inside of the city, or if you're looking for a more laid back lifestyle in your retirement years, the suburbs of Memphis and neighboring communities make for a great place to call home. The median home value is on the low end, so you'll really be able to stretch your retirement dollar here!\n\n### #8 - Murfreesboro\nWell known for its American Civil War History, Murfreesboro makes our list at spot number eight. The affordable median home price of $250,000, and affordable tax rates, make this area a great place for retirees to live. Retired residents can enjoy playing golf at the Old Fort Golf Club, or relax at one of the beautiful outdoor parks. The large Middle Tennessee State University campus keeps the city young at heart, and you'll enjoy plenty of entertainment, shows, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Murfreesboro.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Knoxville\nSituated just an hour north of the great smoky mountains national park, and home to the legendary University of Tennessee college football team, Knoxville surely makes our list of best places to retire in Tennessee. The city of Knoxville is located in East Tennessee and is nearly 1/4 the size of Memphis with a population of 180,000 people. Housing is rather affordable with the average home price being $215,000.\n\n### #6 - Nashville\nLocated in Davidson County, Nashville has our heart and is arguably the gem of Tennessee. There's no question Nashville makes our list of best places to retire. The residents here not only enjoy an international airport which makes traveling convenient, but they are also spoiled with amazing food choices, an endless amount of live entertainment, over 100 parks, and plenty of social clubs and recreation activities all across the city. Between the art scene, and the birthplace of country music, this is undoubtedly amongst the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-nashville-tennessee)**\n\n### #5 - Oak Hill\nAlthough this area is more expensive than other areas of Tennessee, Oak Hill is attracting more and more retirees. This is far enough outside of Nashville if you're seeking a laid back lifestyle, but just a short drive into the city where you can enjoy tons of shows, plays, concerts, restaurants, and museums.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like living in Oak Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-oak-hill-in-nashville)**\n\n### #4 - Pigeon Forge / Gatlinburg\nJust 40 minutes west of the North Carolina border sits Pigeon Forge. We promise, there is nothing more satisfying than having your morning coffee on your back deck overlooking the natural beauty of the great smoky mountains. No matter the season, the smoky mountains of Tennessee will always be a magnificent sight to see. Pigeon Forge is a small town that is well known for its amazing retirement benefits. The low cost of living, pretty views, and ease of access in and out of larger cities, makes this one of the best places to retire in Tennessee.\n\n### #3 - Franklin\nWhy is Franklin one of the best places to retire in Tennessee? Franklin is not only a historically rich town, it's also an affluent town. The active downtown surely promises a great culture. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, museums, and a fantastic music culture, Franklin is nothing shy of an amazing place to be. Your life can be as active as you'd like. There are plenty of outdoor activities to choose from. From walking trails, various parks, and several public golf courses, it's no secret why the population is on the rise!\n\n**[PRO TIP: See our Franklin neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Kingston Springs\nKingston Springs is a beautiful town located in Cheatham County just 20 miles southwest of the big city (Downtown Nashville). The population is shy of 6,000 residents. Residents of Kingston Springs love the several outdoor adventures this rural town provides. Between hiking, fishing in the river, golf, or canoeing, you won't be bored here. Kingston Springs is an incredibly safe place to be with a very low crime rate. Better yet, if the outdoor activities do not keep you busy, you can drive 25 minutes to Downtown Nashville and enjoy all this large metropolitan city has to offer. Most homes in Cheatham County are on over an acre of land so Kingston Springs is our pick for retirees who prefer some privacy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See homes for sale in Kingston Springs](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/kingston-springs)**\n\n### #1 - Tellico Lake\nThe Tellico Lake community tops our list as the best place to retire and for good reason. Anywhere along Tellico Lake is nothing shy of a dream. The lake is 33 miles long and provides over 357 miles of beautiful shoreline. Entertainment and recreation activities are endless. Between boating, fishing, golfing, hiking, and walking trails, you'll love spending your life on the lake! Roughly an hour drive to the smoky mountains and half an hour away from Knoxville, Tellico Lake provides the best of both worlds.\n\n## Areas To Avoid\nNow that we covered the top 10 best places to retire in Tennessee, what are some places you should avoid?\n\n### Davidson County\nWhile the city of Nashville is located in Davidson County, if you're looking to avoid rising property taxes in your retirement years, we would suggest looking for homes outside of county limits. If you're able to put up with [higher property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike), Davidson County has a lot to offer.\n\n### Dyersburg\nDyersburg is one of the cities we'd recommend you avoid. With a population of roughly 17,000, it's surprising how high the crime rate is compared to the national average. The city has struggled to expand and develop over the years. It's located on the west end of Tennessee, and hours away from vibrant, culturally rich, cities.\n\n### Jackson\n70 miles east of Memphis is Jackson Tennessee. Unfortunately, Jackson makes the top 100 most dangerous cities in America list. Much of the city has a household income below the poverty line.\n\n## Looking To Retire In Tennessee?\nIf you're looking to retire in Tennessee, we're here to help. At [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/), we've helped countless clients find their retirement dream home.

Murfreesboro's population is quickly approaching 140,000 residents and is among the fastest-growing cities in all of Tennessee. Why's that? There's so much to love about Murfreesboro from its rich Civil War history to the affordable cost of living. \n\nAdditionally, the city has a fantastic school system, plenty of outdoor parks, and a diverse culture. If you're a foodie, you're in luck. Murfreesboro has many delicious restaurants to choose from, a cute downtown, and is located less than 40 minutes outside of Music City.\n\nThe real estate market is diverse and very competitive. The median home price is just over $300,000.  But make no mistake, you get a lot of value for your buck. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our Murfreesboro neighborhood guide](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #9 - Green Hills \n\nIf you're looking to live in Nashville proper, [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills) may be the right neighborhood for you! Located just 13 miles from the international airport, folks here love the convenience this area has to offer. High-end new construction is popping up all over, and it's causing housing prices to surge! It's not uncommon to pay close to one million dollars for a home in Green Hills.\n\nWith that said, families who live here agree it is well worth the investment. The value really comes from everything this neighborhood has to offer. Between the notorious Bluebird Cafe, various music venues, Lipscomb University, and an endless amount of restaurants, there's so much to like about Green Hills. That being said, many families who live in Green Hills decide to send their children to private schools. If a strong public school district is important to you and your family, we would recommend looking for homes in Williamson County.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-green-hills-in-nashville)**\n\n### #8 - Signal Mountain \n\nSignal Mountain is a suburb of Chattanooga located in Hamilton County. Signal Mountain is without a doubt a fantastic place to live! Residents here enjoy picturesque views year-round, but autumn is arguably the most beautiful time of year.  \n\nIf you love the outdoors, this may be the perfect place for your family. Rainbow lake trail is a popular hiking trail, with plenty of beautiful waterfalls to admire along the trail.  Not only does Signal Mountain glow with natural beauty, but it is also one of the safest towns in Tennessee with low crime rates. \n\nMost people who live in Signal Mountain commute less than 25 minutes to work, and housing will likely run you less than $400,000. The school system is top-rated, and the median household income is above the national average. \n\n### #7 - Nolensville \n\n[Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville) is located about 30 minutes southeast of [downtown Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) and is split between [Williamson](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/williamson-county) and [Davidson](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/davidson-county) counties.

Location. Location.\n\nBut what exactly does location mean, and why is it so important? Location isn't just about the street the property is located on, although that plays a major role. The location also includes; the town, the proximity the home is to various amenities, and how safe the neighborhood is. Why is this so important? You can change the color of your house, update the kitchen, and add an extra bathroom. But you can't change the location of the home. Safety is a key piece to this puzzle, and we've compiled a list of the safest places to live in Tennessee.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Crime That Are Tracked?\n\nBefore we dive into the list of safest places to live in Tennessee, let's first define what safety means, and how a city or town tracks its safety level. There are two main crime statistics that are tracked; violent crimes and property crimes. A key thing to note is that crime rates are benchmarked per 1,000 residents. For example, if 'the violent crime rate in a city is 2 per 1,000.' That simply means, on average, 2 in every 1,000 people are victims of a violent crime. \n\n### Violent Crimes\n\nAccording to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime), violent crimes are \"composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as those offenses which involve a threat of force.\" A town with a low violent crime rate will have fewer reported violent crimes per year. \n\n### Property Crimes\n\nThe [FBI defines](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/property-crime) property crimes as the following offenses; \"burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.\" A town with a low property crime rate will have fewer instances of these crimes being reported per year. \n\nIf you're looking for the [best places to raise a family in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee) or the [best places to retire in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee), you should be looking for a town with low property crime and violent crime rates! \n\n[**PRO TIP: Is The Volunteer State calling your name?

Hermitage’s six waterfront parks, many with trails and boat access, are an anomaly even for Nashville. Another perk of the town’s maturity is its developed restaurant district with enough tantalizing options that you might find yourself forgetting that [Downtown Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) is such an easy drive away.\n\n#### Who is Hermitage a good fit for?\n\nHermitage may be known for its namesake, “The Hermitage,” President Andrew Jackson’s residence, but this Nashville suburb hosts young families, nature-lovers, and retirees looking for large yards and a neighborly atmosphere.

Its green spaces reflect this. You will still find plenty of places to enjoy the great outdoors. The two most popular places to hike within the city limits are Percy Warner Park and Radnor Lake State Park. Both offer a variety of scenic trails and wildlife. As for parks, Centennial Park is a prime spot for having a picnic, taking photos, and enjoying the fresh air.\n\nJust beyond town, the hiking spots are nearly unlimited. Marcella Vivrette Park is a top choice for trail running, and The Trails at Fontanel offer an ideal dog walking spot.\n\nFor those that really want to escape the city and get lost in nature, there are short trails leading to waterfalls and longer trails of varying difficulty. Twin Falls and Burgess Falls Trail are both about an hour and a half away from downtown and offer magical scenes. Fall Creek Falls is a must-see for anyone living in or near Nashville. In fact, this fantastic state park is worth visiting every season as the breathtaking scenery evolves from burgeoning green to brilliant fall color and frigid icy natural architecture.\n\n## Nashville's Economy Is Booming\n\nNashville remains a young and growing city with economic opportunities in diverse industries.

HCA Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company, also calls Nashville “home.” \n\nAnd while these major companies will continue to encourage healthy economic growth, new Fortune 500 companies continue to move to The Music City. NTT Data is one of the newest to join the city’s thriving economy.\n\nNashville also offers abundant opportunities in its historic and well-established music industry along with publishing, tourism, healthcare, technology, advertising, and the growing food scene. As more and more companies allow employees to work from home, Nashville becomes an even more popular choice for young professionals.\n\n## Nashville Is Events Galore From Music To Sports And Everything In Between\n\nIt’s likely no surprise to you that Nashville hosts a plethora of live music shows throughout the year. But did you know that Nashville offers sporting events and arts events throughout the year? The Country Music Awards are also hosted in downtown Nashville annually. \n\nAs home to the Titans, you can catch a football game. If hockey is your thing, the Nashville Predators have a huge fan following in the city. The Nashville Soccer Club is the newest kid on the block when it comes to Nashville sports, but this Major League Soccer team is really kicking the fun into high gear.\n\nAnd if country music isn’t your jam, you will find a diverse mixture of music venues featuring an array of genres.

The [average home price in the Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville) city limits is $474,939. Those looking for a lower mortgage or a more expansive yard often go beyond Nashville-proper and find a home in the mid-$300,000s. \n\nNashville locals also appreciate the fact that the [low cost of living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/cost-of-living-nashville) in a big city affords them the opportunity to enjoy all the activities the city has to offer.\n\nFor young professionals and singles that may not need as large of a home (or have the free time to mow a lawn), there are plenty of attractive, modern, and convenient [townhomes](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville/townhouses) and [condos](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville/condos) in Nashville that will not break the budget. These housing options often range between $200,000 and $300,000.\n\nDavidson County property tax rates are .82%, which means you will pay just over $4,000 for the average home and $2,000 for a townhome.\n\nWith no state income tax, Tennessee residents get to keep more of their income in their pockets. Local taxes also won’t break the bank, at 7% state sales tax with another 2.25% county tax within Davidson County.\n\nNashville offers diverse home types, affordable events, and an easy way of life for those lucky enough to live in the Music City.","author":"Felix Homes","slug":"where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals","title":"2025's Top 6 Nashville Neighborhoods for Singles \u0026 Young Professionals","isFeatured":false,"locationGroup1Heading":"Top 6 Nashville Neighborhoods For Singles And Young Professionals","description":"Are you young, single, and ready to move to Nashville?

Make the right choice for your entire family. Help your kids get settled into the right school. We examined which Nashville Suburbs have the best school districts. We focused on traditional suburbs in the Nashville area. This article doesn’t cover private schools or schools in Davidson County.  Although, there are some great options there. Each school district has its pros and cons, and we hope you can narrow down your findings with our list.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Our Methodology For Determining The Best School Districts\n\nWe went straight to the source when compiling our data. First, we looked at the [Tennessee State Report Card](https://reportcard.tnedu.gov/) provided by the state government. Then, we compared school districts based on standardized test scores, student-teacher ratios, the amount spent per student, graduation rates, and college acceptance rates. We favored test scores and graduation rates over other statistics. Picking a school is no easy choice, but we chose to look at the numbers here.\n\n## Key Highlights\n\n- **Schools with the smallest students to teacher ratio** - Sumner County Schools boast a 14:1 student to teacher ratio. But also check out Franklin Special School District with an 11:1 ratio, but this district is only K-8.\n\n- **Schools with the highest test scores** - Williamson County wins this category by a landslide with an average ACT score of 25.3.\n\n- **Schools that spend the most per student** - Williamson County Schools spends an average of $11,165 per student annually, but K-8 district FSSD spends an impressive $15,582!\n\n- **Schools with the highest graduation rates** - Williamson County has the highest graduation rate, and 85.6% enroll in college the following year.\n\n## Nashville Suburbs With The Best School District (Ranked!)\n\n### #1. Williamson County\n\nLocated south of Nashville. Williamson County includes many desirable communities for families: [Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood), [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin), [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville), [Fairview](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/fairview), [Thompson’s Station](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/thompsons-station), [Arrington](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/arrington), and [Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill). Williamson County boasts excellent schools with rigorous academics, but a downside will be the cost of living. Williamson County is the most expensive school district to live in on this list. However, there are many communities where houses can go for millions, like in [The Governor’s Club](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/brentwood/governors-club). \n\nWilliamson County is an excellent place for families to live. There is a charming [historic downtown area](https://visitfranklin.com/) that brings people to Franklin. Families choose to live in Williamson County for the schools and its reputation for having many of the [safest communities](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee). Williamson county is full of housing, shopping, restaurants, schools, and parks. So it’s the perfect place to raise kids. We chose it as our number one pick due to test scores, reasonable teacher-to-student ratio, and high graduation rate.\n\n**[PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Williamson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/williamson-county)**\n\n#### Here are some stats on Williamson County Schools:\n- Williamson County’s average ACT score is 25.3. In the state of Tennessee, this easily qualifies students for the [HOPE Scholarship program](https://www.tn.gov/collegepays/money-for-college/tn-education-lottery-programs/tennessee-hope-scholarship.html) for college.\n\n- As a school system that has classes from Pre-K- 12 grades, there is a 17:1 student-teacher ratio. \n\n- Teachers in Williamson County are experienced educators, and only 4% are in their first or second year of teaching. \n\n- The average cost per student is $11,165.\n\n- The graduation rate for Williamson County students is 96.5%, and 85.6% of students go onto college. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### #2. Sumner County\n\nSumner County comes in on our list at number two. Sumner and Wilson were comparable, but we chose to rank Sumner higher due to their student-to-teacher ratio. Many suburban dwellers don’t always consider the suburbs to the north of Nashville. But with great accessibility to Nashville and East Nashville, Sumner County has a lot of value for families looking for a great place to raise a family.  \n\nSumner County has the [Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville) and [Gallatin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/gallatin) communities and is a very desirable north of Nashville suburb. Hendersonville is home to [The Streets of Indian Lake](https://streetsofindianlake.com/), Johnny Cash’s house, and many lakefront properties. With a home price of $308,000, Sumner County is a more affordable option compared to others on this list.\n\n**[PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Sumner County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/sumner-county)**\n\n#### Here are some stats on Sumner County Schools:\n- The average ACT score for Sumner County is 21.\n\n- Sumner County offers public schooling to garages Pre-K- 12th grade. \n\n- In Sumner County, 95.4% of students graduate high school, and 72.2% of students pursue post-secondary degrees. \n\n- $9,178 is spent on students in Sumner County annually.\n\n- The student-to-teacher ratio is low at 14:1.\n\n### #3. Wilson County\n\nWilson County is experiencing a building boom, and it can be an excellent option for a family looking for a new house. Wilson County is increasing in price, just like the rest of Nashville. But places like [Mt. Juliet](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/mount-juliet) are still experiencing some affordability. Mt. Juliet is situated east of Nashville and has conveniences like [Providence Marketplace](https://shopprovidencemarketplace.com/).\n\nWe ranked Wilson County third on our list for its ACT scores and its graduation rate.\n\n**[PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Wilson County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/wilson-county)**\n\n#### Here are some stats on Wilson County Schools:\n- Wilson County educates students in grades PK-12.\n\n- The average ACT score in Wilson County is 20.9.\n\n- In Wilson County, the graduation rate is 96.1%, and 67.3% of students go on to higher education.\n\n- The average amount of money spent on each child is $8,348.\n\n- There is a ratio of 15:1 students to teachers.\n\n### #4. Rutherford County\n\nRutherford County contains the city of [Murfreesboro](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/murfreesboro) and is a rapidly growing city. Murfreesboro is home to [Middle Tennessee State University](https://mtsu.edu/), Tennessee’s second-biggest school after the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Murfreesboro is a large enough city where it functions entirely separately from Nashville but is still accessible for commuting. There’s a variety of housing options at a variety of price points. There’s also plenty of schools, parks, shopping, restaurants, and activities for your family. \n\nWe put Rutherford County 4th for its test scores, but we love how much they spend on each student and their relatively low student-to-teacher ratios. \n\n**[PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Rutherford County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/rutherford-county)**\n\n#### Here are some stats on Rutherford County Schools:\n- The average ACT score for Rutherford County students is 20.8. \n\n- Rutherford County is a large district with grades K-12. \n\n- The graduation rate is 95.6%, and 63.5% of students go on to college. \n\n- The per-pupil expenditure is $9,201.\n\n- The ratio of students to teachers is 15:1.\n\n### #5. Cheatham County\n\nCheatham County is the most affordable school district to live in on this list. Home to [Ashland City](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/ashland-city), which is a small town with a downtown area. This is a good choice for a family that wants a smaller and more rural school system. Unfortunately, you will not find as many amenities in this area, but you will find space. Cheatham County is accessible to Nashville, and you will have to go to Bellevue for many conveniences. \n\nWe put them fifth on our list for their graduation rate and average ACT score.\n\n**[PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Cheatham County](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/county/tn/cheatham-county)**\n\n#### Here are some stats on Cheatham County Schools:\n- Cheatham County is the smallest school district on this list serving Pre-K- 12th grade. \n\n- The average ACT score in Cheatham county is 19.6.\n\n- At 91.9% graduation rate, Cheatham County’s high schoolers go on to college at 57.6% of the time.\n\n- $8,384 is spent on each student in Cheatham County annually.\n\n## Honorable Mention\n\n### Franklin Special School District\n\nFSSD is a hidden gem that we think you should look into, and this is why it gets our honorable mention. By the state’s statistics, this school system should be topping our list. But the only thing holding it back is that it only serves grades K-8.\n\nFranklin Special School District gets many questions from out-of-towners moving to Nashville who are looking for schools. This school district exists inside Franklin city’s limits and is more diverse than other schools in the area. The ratio of students to teachers is staggeringly low, and they put many resources into each student. Once students move onto high school, they are put into Williamson County High Schools.\n\n#### Here are some stats on Franklin Special School District:\n- Only serves grade PK-8\n\n- Located in the city limits of Franklin, TN, and then feeds into Williamson County high schools.\n\n- More diverse compared to Williamson County\n\n- This district spends $15,582 per student\n\n- Student to teacher ratio is a fantastic 11:1!\n\n## Felix Homes Can Help You Find The Perfect Nashville Suburb To Send Your Kids To School\n\nWe know that where you raise your children can be one of the most significant decisions a parent can make.

We’ve highlighted some of the best ones below. \n\n[**PRO TIP: Check out our complete guide for the best places for families to live in Tennessee.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee)\n\n### Brentwood\n\nYou will see Brentwood on our lists for best communities for families, the safest place to live, the wealthiest, and more! It’s a city that checks a lot of boxes. Brentwood is just 15 minutes south of Nashville, and people desire it for its luxury and convenience. The schools in Brentwood are top-notch, and you will find many award-winning private and public school options. Homes in Brentwood are typically large, on large lots, and are single-family homes. So this is perfect for you and your family. It may sound too good to be true, but Brentwood’s biggest downside is its price. Brentwood is one of the most expensive places to live in Tennessee. But residents think it’s worth it for the good schools, safety, and proximity to Nashville. You will find home prices over $800,000, and it’s hard to find this many amenities anywhere else. \n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Brentwood.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood)\n\n### Nolensville\n\n![2175130-0 (1).jpg](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2175130_0_1_3d1c5e4b0a.jpg)\n\nYou can find Nolensville on the northeastern border between Davidson and Williamson County. It’s an excellent option for families looking for new homes near Nashville and the airport.

In this case, we recommend Germantown, the suburb of Memphis, as an excellent choice for families. The population of Germantown is around 40,000, and it will take you about twenty minutes to commute to your job if you work in Memphis. \n\nHousing in Germantown can be on the pricey side at $375,000 to $450,000 for a single-family home. But this may be worth it when you consider the schools, parks, shopping, and restaurants in this West Tennessee town. If you’re looking for the perfect community to raise a family in Memphis, don’t sleep on Germantown. \n\n## Safest Places To Live In Tennessee\n\nYour new home should bring you a sense of security.

Crime is 47% below the national average, and most crime relates to theft. As a suburb of Nashville, this statistic is astounding. Franklin is bigger than nearby places like Brentwood, with over 80,000 people. But beyond the stats, Franklin feels like a safe place to settle down. Its historic downtown area is the perfect place to leisurely stroll and sip a coffee. Franklin’s numerous outdoor areas are perfect for a sunny day, its farmer’s market is the best in the state, and the civil war history is immense. \n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Franklin.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin)\n\n### Mount Juliet\n\nIs your ideal location east of Nashville?

Each city will take on the character of these regions. Here's the low-down of Tennessee’s best cities.\n\n### Nashville\n\n![downtown.jpg](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/downtown_5c67f0f28e.jpg)\n\nNashville may just have it all: culture, jobs, and [family-friendly communities](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families). Nashville is the birthplace of country music, and there is no shortage of live music.

Knoxville is in East Tennessee and at the base of the Appalachian Mountains. As the self-proclaimed “scruffiest city,” Knoxville has great outdoor vibes. You will love having the Great Smoky Mountains in your backyard. Knoxville is also home to the University of Tennessee, so Saturday football games are huge for Knoxvillians in the fall. You will also enjoy access to some of the best waterfront properties in Tennessee when you move to Knoxville, where living costs are also low. Farragut is a family-friendly suburb in Knoxville with excellent schools.\n\n### Chattanooga\n\nChattanooga is the smallest of Tennessee’s major cities and is also located in East Tennessee on the Georgia border.

Collierville is a family-friendly Memphis area suburb that you should consider as well.\n\n## Best Places For Singles \u0026 Young Professionals To Live In Tennessee\n\nIf you’re planning your move to Tennessee and you’re worried the state is too rural for you as a single person or young professional, your best bet is to stick close to Tennessee’s major cities.

Check out our in-depth article on where [singles and young professionals should live in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals).\n\n## LGBT-Friendly Places To Live In Tennessee\n\n![Image of a person holding a gay pride flag.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9_LGBT_Friendly_Places_To_Live_In_Tennessee_f8d9041f8e.png)\n\nAre you worried about moving to Tennessee and clashing with people who oppose [LGBT](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/lgbt-friendly-places-to-live-in-tennessee) ways of life?

Tennessee is home to some seriously affluent communities. You will have access to the communities, prestige, services, schools, and amenities of living among the wealthy. Here are a few of the most affluent communities for you to consider before making your move.\n\n[**PRO TIP: See our complete guide of the wealthiest cities in Tennessee.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/richest-cities-in-tennessee)\n\n### Forest Hills\n\nWith a median household income of $299,069 and a median property value of $853,000, Forest Hills is a pricey place to lay down roots. Forest Hills is a town inside of Davidson County but opted out from becoming a part of the consolidated metropolitan government in Nashville. So you get your own exclusive enclave, but you still get to call Nashville home. Forest Hills has many treed lots with large homes. There are no businesses here, so you will have to head over to Nashville or Brentwood for services, stores, and restaurants. But if a big house and a big yard is your thing in Nashville, then this may be your place.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Forest Hills.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/forest-hills)\n\n### Belle Meade\n\nBelle Meade is what you think of when you hear “old money.” You will find that driving along Belle Meade Boulevard with the large historic homes and exclusive country clubs. Like Forest Hills, Belle Meade is a separate town that exists inside of Davidson County in Nashville. Residents here make on average $220,417 per household each year, and the average property value comes in at $860,000. This is also the place to live if you want to live close to Percy Warner Park (Nashville’s best park) and have access to all of the amenities of west Nashville.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Belle Meade.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/belle-meade)\n\n### Oak Hill\n\nWhile Brentwood deserves to be on this top three, we’ve included Oak Hill because Brentwood has been mentioned above. Oak Hill is just a few miles north of Brentwood. Like Belle Meade and Forest Hills, it is a community that decided not to consolidate into Metro Nashville’s government. So it is another enclave of wealth inside of Nashville. Oak Hill has one of Nashville’s most popular treasures: Radnor Lake. This is a lake with hiking trails that exists inside Nashville. (It’s impossible to even get a parking spot on a beautiful day because it’s so popular.) Oak Hill boasts large houses on large lots and is home to many celebrities and country singers. A house in Oak Hill will average in value at $719,000. So you will pay to live in this exclusive community.\n\n[**PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Oak Hill.**](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/oak-hill)\n\n## Most Affordable Places To Live In Tennessee\n\nYour move to Tennessee should simplify your life. Part of that should involve getting more for your money when you’re home shopping. You can find many affordable options in rural areas in Tennessee. So if you have ever dreamed of having that perfect piece of land or farm, now’s the time to make that move. But there are also a few [suburbs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs) and [neighborhoods](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/most-affordable-nashville-suburbs) in the Nashville area where you can get a great deal.

This will mean you can find good deals on houses and land, but you will not find every amenity in town. You can get to Nashville amenities in around half an hour. Kingston Springs is also an excellent option for those wanting a deal near Nashville. If you’re an outdoor enthusiast, this tight-knit community is on the Harpeth River. This is the perfect river for a float or kayak ride in the summer. There’s also a free splash pad at Burns Park that kids love to flock to in the summer, and you will also love Skyking Pizza as well.

The key stat, \"Months of Supply\" rose to 4.27 months meaning **we are no longer in a seller's market**.\n\n🏠 - Just 683 homes closed in Davidson County this June – **a staggering 18% fewer** than in June 2023.\n\n📉 - Average \u0026 median sales price figures are misleading as they **only account for closed transactions** – not the inventory that's been sitting.\n\n🪓 - Price cuts are on the rise nationally. **34.4% of homes** on the market have taken a price cut. I don't think prices will plummet (*[like they are in Austin](https://www.axios.com/local/austin/2024/03/04/austin-luxury-home-prices-decline)*) but I do think sellers need to be more realistic when listing.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## June In-Depth Analysis\n\n### Supply-Side: \n\nLike any market, the health of the real estate market is defined by the number of willing buyers (demand) compared to the number of active listings (supply). \n\nThroughout most of 2023, the number of new listings being added to the market each month has been less than in years past (*see New Listings chart below*). \n\nThis is because most homeowners can't justify selling their home and giving up their low mortgage rate (below 4%) when the current rate for a 30-year mortgage is around 7%.\n\n![June New Listings.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_New_Listings_ecec909386.png)\n\nSo, fewer new listings are being added to the market each month and homes are not selling as quickly as in 2022 or 2023 so the **total inventory** (*i.e. the number of homes added to the market + the active inventory that has been sitting on the market*) continues to rise each month (*see Total Inventory chart below*).\n\nFor example, in June 2022 total inventory was 2,791. Compare that to 3,133  in June 2023 and **3,417 in June 2024**. You can clearly see a trend starting to emerge. \n\n![June Total Inventory.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_Total_Inventory_d570aa2aab.png)\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nNow that we know the supply side of the market is starting to rise, let's take a look at how the demand side of the market is performing.\n\nOne way to gauge buyer demand is by looking at the number of closings each month (*see Closings chart below*).\n\nFor example, 1,094 homes closed in June 2022 compared to just 835 closings in June 2023 and 646 in June 2024 – another trend starting to emerge.\n\n![June Closings.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_Closings_6962fd6af8.png)\n\nAnd, for those thinking that June might have just been a fluke, sadly it was not. If we compare the number of closings in aggregate since the beginning of each year, it looks like we are slightly below 2023's performance (*see Closings Aggregate chart below*).\n\n![June Closings (Aggregate).png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_Closings_Aggregate_14ee824eda.png)\n\nSo, at this point, we've looked at the supply side of the market and determined how many homes are closing each month. If only there was a stat that could compare the current level of supply in relation to the demand we've seen 🤔.\n\nLuckily for us, there is and it's called the \"**Months of Supply**\"! Given the current sales pace, this is a measure of how long it would take for all the current homes on the market to sell if no new homes were added.\n\n**As a quick reminder from last month's market update:**\n\n- **1 to 3 months of supply:** Seller's market (high demand, low inventory)\n- **4 to 6 months of supply:** Balanced market\n- **7+ months of supply:** Buyer's market (low demand, high inventory)\n\nIn June 2022, months of supply was 1.57 months – a strong seller's market. June 2023 saw months of supply rise to 3 – still a seller's market. **In June 2024, months of supply spiked to 4.52** – unusual during a time of the year (summer market) when months of supply is historically very low. It will be interesting to watch if months of supply continues to spike heading into the winter. \n\n![June Months of Supply.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_Months_of_Supply_ac0a96beb3.png)\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nThe trend of increased inventory and slowing buyer demand has been playing out over the past year and a half. **While I don't expect prices to rise much in the coming 6-12 months, I also don't expect prices will plummet**.\n\nHome prices have remained resilient. According to the data, the median home price in Davidson County has actually increased from $490,000 in June 2023 to $525,000 in June 2024.\n\n**Keep in mind that this data only incorporates CLOSED SALES**! It does not consider the stale, overpriced listings that have been sitting on the market month after month.\n\nOn a related note, it's interesting to see the widening gap between the average sales price and median sales price in Davidson County over the past 5 years (*see Median and Average Sales Price chart below*). \n\nCould this be a sign of the widening wealth gap? After all, Nashville continues to set records whether it be a [$15M downtown condo](https://therealdeal.com/national/nashville/2024/06/25/raising-canes-owner-to-set-record-for-priciest-nashville-condo/) or $4M new construction homes in Green Hills that have seemingly become normal. \n\n![June Median and Average Sales Price.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_Median_and_Average_Sales_Price_593523c751.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates have been the enemy of buyers AND sellers for just under two years now. Buyers want lower rates in hopes of a lower monthly payment. Sellers want lower rates in hopes it will bring buyers back to the market.\n\nAs of June 30th, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.92% but has since risen back above 7% in the past week.\n\nIt doesn't look like we'll get relief anytime soon. While the Federal Reserve is still anticipating [one rate cut this year](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-policymakers-see-just-one-rate-cut-this-year-4-cuts-2025-2024-06-12/#:~:text=June%2012%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20U.S.,slowly%20than%20they%20had%20expected.), it is likely that mortgage rates will remain well above 6% for the next 12-24 months.\n\n![Average 30-Year Mortgage Rate.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Average_30_Year_Mortgage_Rate_7be94206bc.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In: \n\nAs rates and home prices remain elevated, affordability continues to be at an all-time low. For example, with a 6.92% mortgage, a homebuyer will pay 1.38X the loan amount in interest over the life of the loan – let that sink in for a moment.\n\nTo combat high rates, and to compete with the incentives many new construction home builders are offering, some sellers have started offering money that buyers can use towards a rate buydown. \n\nA buydown is a way for a borrower to obtain a lower interest rate by paying discount points at closing. This is a temporary solution that may allow a buyer to have a lower interest rate for a few years with the hope of being able to refinance their 30-year mortgage once interest rates come back down.\n\n![June Home Affordability Comparison.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/June_Home_Affordability_Comparison_f6eb9da8ee.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

Hill Urban Market and barbershops like Collins and Co. allow you to have fun with a side of functionality. And if you’re looking for a little quiet, the popular Nashville Public Library is just a few blocks down from the Ryman. Nashville is also one of the few cosmopolitan centers that offers easy escapes from the concrete jungle. Run along the Cumberland River, or hike up the hill to check out the State House’s sprawling grounds. It’s the perfect mix for downtown living, and while downtown Nashvegas rarely sleeps, at least you’ll never have to use a car to get around either.\n\n## East End - The Locals' Neighborhood\n\nThe tourists can have downtown, as long as the locals get 5 Points, the exceedingly cool East Nashville neighborhood for nightlife, restaurants, shops, and pretty much whatever else you can imagine. East End’s location just to the south of this district makes it one of the most walkable (and enviable) neighborhoods in all of Tennessee. Walkscore.com, in fact, rates it as the [most walkable Nashville neighborhood](https://www.walkscore.com/TN/Nashville-Davidson). Whatever trendy, high-end service or shops you can imagine are probably within walking distance, and the restaurants are so varied and niche that there’s even one dedicated to Grilled Cheese (The Grilled Cheeserie—you’re welcome). The area also drips with close, eclectic coffee shops we recommend you check out—like Bongo East and Donut Distillery—that can turn a breakfast craving into an all-day hangout. There’s no better place to spend a workday than the nearby coffee shop.\n\nIt’s no surprise that neighborhoods this walkable are also a popular place for other exercise-based forms of transportation. The neighborhood supports both a skate shop and a bike shop, and the East Nasty Running Club meets there every Wednesday night for a community run a couple hundred strong. It’s probably a good idea to burn a few calories before walking over to Five Points for a couple of beers and some live music.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like living in East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-east-nashville)**\n\n## The Gulch - The Trendy Neighborhood\n\nIf you think you have to leave the South to get that true urban living experience, then you haven’t looked hard enough at The Gulch, home to Nashville’s shamelessly swanky hotels and entertainment located just a few blocks from Downtown. It's home to classic downtown living, with new highrise condos over sophisticated shops and popular breweries, you won't find any single-family homes here. The complex covers everything from nearby nightlife to groceries; and while you may put the elevator to good use, your car will wonder where you’ve been. \n\nThe Gulch even complements your emission-free choice of locomotion through its status as a LEED community. This means it was designed at the cutting edge of sustainable technology, resulting in an attractive mix of convenience, class, and conservation at the very core of Nashville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out why locals and tourists love The Gulch](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-the-gulch-in-nashville)**\n\n## West End And Midtown\n\nWest End is a local business district-turned high-rise paradise just west of 12 South and nestled between two urban oases: Centennial Park and the lovely Vanderbilt University. With the help of these neighbors, Midtown pulls off a laid-back, collegiate vibe that’s rare in a conventional cityscape. It’s no surprise, then, that this eclectic community is home to one of Nashville’s most diverse restaurant districts around. Sure you get a few of those chain restaurants and cheap pizza joints that cater to the college crowd (although who doesn’t enjoy a greasy late-night slice every once in a while?), but peppered among them is a loaded slate of spots within walking distance. \n\nIn the true spirit of education, coffee shops like Cafe Coco offer plenty of patio seating tailor-made for a leisurely workday. Then dinner is a veritable smorgasbord. Feeling Sushi? Go with Samurai Sushi. Crave an Indian food fix? Sitar is right down the street. Wanna load up at a Brazilian steakhouse? Try Texas de Brazil next to Centennial Park. We won’t even go into the batch of excellent less-exotic grub options (except for Clyde’s sports bar, that is), or the accessible upscale bars that dot the local area. Ultimately, Midtown is everything its name suggests, with all your needs covered within just a few city blocks.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's everything you need to know about living in West End](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-west-end-in-nashville)**\n\n## Hope Gardens Neighborhood\n\nWith a walk score of 76, this Nashville niche just edges out Germantown—its next door neighbor—for convenience. It’s not difficult to see why Hope Gardens gets the nod. With its location close to the foot of the Statehouse lawn, the neighborhood’s front yard is essentially the Bicentennial Mall, and the Nashville Farmers Market might as well be its cafeteria. This basically ensures that you’ll never run out of options for food or outdoor entertainment.\n\nThe best part is that all these urban amenities include plenty of neighborhood feel. Most of the homes are quaint, unattached, single-family dwellings on small lots. There are a few apartment buildings, but not enough to threaten the sensation that you’ve found a cozy village in the middle of a new metropolis. Oh, and if you still want a little taste of that highfalutin cosmopolitan lifestyle, you can always hop over to Germantown. It’s an easy walk right across Jefferson Street.\n\n## Edgehill Neighborhood\n\nEdgehill, with over 4,000 residents, makes the list as one of Nashville’s larger distinct neighborhoods. Edgehill Road offers a consistent mix of new restaurants and other community businesses right in the district’s heart. Between this main drag and the few satellite business districts that orbit it, residents are never far from fulfilling their needs. \n\nPerhaps its greatest attribute, however, is that it provides a family-friendly alternative to Nashville’s more cosmopolitan, antiseptic areas. Parks, including Reservoir and Rose Park, take up significant percentages of the neighborhood real estate, and at Edgehill’s center is a quality elementary-middle school combination. For those who need to steal a break from the family grind, though, Edgehill still has you covered with classy touches like Barcelona Wine Bar.\n\nThose willing to tack on a few extra steps might also appreciate the neighborhood’s unique position in the city. With The Gulch to the north, Midtown to the west, and Belmont University to the south, this sleepier residential district rests right between some of Nashville’s hippest areas. There’s nothing wrong with checking these out and then strolling back to your quieter Edgehill haven.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out homes for sale in Edgehill](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/edgehill)**\n\nWant to find your own walkable Nashville residence?

Perhaps the most famous of the Southeast’s iconic downtowns pulses with the energy of a Merle Haggard melody. It’s the main attraction for Nashville’s nearly 15 million visitors per year, the heart and soul of the Music City. Downtown is more than just the bars off Broadway, however. The area between I-65 and the Cumberland River, terminating at Jefferson Street, includes eight distinct neighborhoods that each provide a different taste of downtown living.

Hermitage’s six waterfront parks, many with trails and boat access, are an anomaly even for Nashville. Another perk of the town’s maturity is its developed restaurant district with enough tantalizing options that you might find yourself forgetting that [Downtown Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) is such an easy drive away.\n\n#### Who is Hermitage a good fit for?\n\nHermitage may be known for its namesake, “The Hermitage,” President Andrew Jackson’s residence, but this Nashville suburb hosts young families, nature-lovers, and retirees looking for large yards and a neighborly atmosphere.

First-time visitors to the city have trouble making it past the bright lights of Broadway and the classic [downtown Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown) music venues and nightlife, and even veteran tourists might not venture farther than the urban neighborhoods like [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville) or [Sylvan Park](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/sylvan-park). What they don't realize is that the city's greatest charm lies not in its downtown tourist attractions, but in the suburbs, its residents call home. Those looking to buy a home and put down roots in Music City have plenty of incredible suburban options that are [especially popular with young families](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-place-for-families-to-live-in-tennessee).

This booming suburb is north of the city in Sumner County. It's still somewhat rural, but new developments pop up each week. You have access to Nashville and Hendersonville for modern conveniences, but you can still see farms and wildlife in Goodlettsville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like to live in Goodlettsville, Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-goodlettsville-tennessee)**\n\n### #11 - Gallatin\n\nGallatin is located north of Nashville on Old Hickory Lake. So it's great if you are looking for outdoor activities: hiking, boating, and fishing. Gallatin is one of the few affordable suburbs that's convenient to Nashville. Public schools in the area rank high. It's a great affordable suburb for families to consider when moving to Nashville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's our guide to Gallatin](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-gallatin-tennessee)**\n\n### #10 - Murfreesboro\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Murfreesboro Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Murfreesboro_0848c9ab34.jpg)\n\nMurfreesboro is essentially a standalone city that happens to fall within the Nashville Metro umbrella. Although it's just a little over thirty minutes from downtown, it's a fully developed city, with a major state university (Middle Tennessee State University), a diverse real estate market, and strong local schools. [Murfreesboro real estate](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/murfreesboro) is freeing for residents who find that it meets their every need, so they aren't bound to downtown Nashville like some other locations. Perhaps that's why Murfreesboro often ranks as one of the top places to live in the entire United States. One reason for this is that, unlike some other Nashville suburbs, this 125,000-resident community caters to the needs of all walks of life. Sure, it has its fair share of [swanky mansions](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/murfreesboro/luxury-homes) and upscale [new construction](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/murfreesboro/new-construction-homes) (this is still a Nashville suburb, after all), but there are also plenty of [affordable housing options](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/murfreesboro/cheap-homes) that make it possible for almost anyone to call Murfreesboro home. Pair this with a town that offers plenty to do, and you have a recipe for suburban bliss. The area is saturated with restaurants affordable enough to welcome MTSU's expansive student population. Between meals, history buffs will enjoy the Stones River National Battlefield, a Civil War site slightly in the direction of downtown Nashville. Whatever diversion you prefer, though, chances are Murfreesboro is somewhere you'll want to call home.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our neighborhood guide for Murfreesboro](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-murfreesboro-tennessee)**\n\n### #9 - Green Hills\n\nJust outside the beltway, less than 15 minutes from downtown, [Green Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/green-hills) has long been one of the Nashville area's premier places to call home. As one of Nashville's original commuter communities, the neighborhood appeals to Nashville's population of high-powered professionals. Over the years, ranch houses on large lots have given way to striking new construction that can cost well over a million dollars. Residents will tell you, however, that the Green Hills lifestyle is totally worth the investment.  The Mall at Green Hills provides some of the best shopping in the state of Tennessee, with those rare department stores and new boutiques that cater to an exclusive clientele. But don't make the mistake of thinking that this community is all style and no substance. Lipscomb University calls Green Hills home, and Vanderbilt and Belmont are just a neighborhood away. What's more, the famed Bluebird Cafe, the small music venue where dozens of famous country stars got their big breaks, sits right at the heart of Green Hills. The combination of all these attractive cultural hotspots ensures that Green Hills retains valuable diversity, and even attracts a considerable population of retirees. That's right, entertainment, history, education, and low crime rates have turned Green Hills into one of the top neighborhoods in Tennessee for [living out those golden years](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee). No matter the type of resident, though, Green Hills remains one of the best suburbs in Nashville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: This is what living in Green Hills is all about](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-green-hills-in-nashville)**\n\n### #8 - Nolensville\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Nolensville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Nolensville_0f58090021.jpg)\n\nNolensville might be a little ways out of town compared to traditional suburbs like Brentwood and Green Hills, but we would be remiss if we didn't recognize [Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville) as an up-and-coming retreat from the downtown work life. It has the vibe of the next Spring Hill, with [large new construction houses](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nolensville/new-construction-homes) driving median home prices up into the $400K-$500K range. Basically, it makes the list as a top location for family homes, even though its downtown and restaurant scene is still a work in progress.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our guide to Nolensville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-nolensville-tennessee)**\n\n### #7 - Bellevue\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Bellevue Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Bellevue_33f68e1ab7.jpg)\n\nFor those who are in love with the Belle Meade area, but aren't thrilled about the price tag, [Bellevue](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/bellevue) offers an affordable real estate alternative with plenty of housing options. About 20 minutes from downtown, it's truly a treasure amongst the rolling hills of Nashville's southern suburbs. It's an established neighborhood, with plenty of older homes that keep prices from ballooning like those in other Nashville suburbs. There are even plenty of apartments available toward downtown, which is a refreshing alternative to most suburbs of Nashville that seem almost exclusively tailored to detached single-family homes. Great location and affordable housing options make Bellevue one of the best communities for [young professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals) looking for a home base that offers easy access to activities. Fortunately, many of these attractions are located within or near the community itself. Bellevue is the place for outdoor lovers, with many parks and hiking areas often linked by greenways along the Harpeth River. It's also right next to Percy Warner Park, a recreational crown jewel of the Nashville suburbs that links Bellevue and Belle Meade. For a less rustic option, enjoy a stroll along the pathways of Cheekwood Botanical Gardens, an estate built and maintained by the Maxwell House Coffee fortune. With all these entertainment options, this entrenched, diverse residential community only 20 minutes from the big city is a rare find in the Nashville market. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's what it's like to live in Bellevue](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-bellevue-in-nashville)**\n\n### #6 - Hendersonville\n\nIf you're looking for a place with a less conventional suburban lifestyle, then [Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville) might just be where you'll want to live. Few suburbs offer lakeside living within thirty minutes of downtown, but Hendersonville is home to two huge peninsulas along Old Hickory Lake. This abundance of [waterfront property](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville/waterfront-homes) makes the area a unique haven from big city work life. Considering its lakeside location, the community boasts a surprisingly affordable cost of living, with median home values usually oscillating between $300K and $400K. Of course, there are plenty of waterfront [mansions](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville/luxury-homes), but there are also lots of modest homes with a water view, and even some undeveloped lots for those looking to build their own home. Hendersonville is an older community, old enough that Johnny and June called the place home, so it has resisted the [new construction](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/hendersonville/new-construction-homes) boom that's transforming so many Nashville suburbs. This market consistency has kept Hendersonville relatively affordable and accessible to many different types of people. And even if waterfront living isn't in your budget, the area still offers plenty of spots, like Rockland Recreation Area and Memorial Park that can get you on the water. \n\n**[PRO TIP: This is what it's like living in Hendersonville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-hendersonville-tennessee)**\n\n### #5 - Franklin\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Franklin Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Franklin_e2b8747a53.jpg)\n\nIf you crave that small-town feel without compromising on the cosmopolitan lifestyle, then [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) is the Nashville suburb you've been looking for. Its upscale reputation starts with a [charming downtown district](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/franklin/downtown-franklin), where [historic Victorian homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin/historic-homes) line the shaded walkable streets. Within just a few blocks, residents can shop for exquisite art, dine on foodie-worthy fare, stop by the farmer's market, and snag that perfect cup of coffee–many don't even step in a car. This relaxed downtown living along a bend in the Harpeth River makes Franklin one of the best suburbs in the Nashville area. Unfortunately for home seekers, this means fairly stiff competition for properties in the area. The vast majority of single-family homes in Franklin are over $400K, and the ones that don't tend to be outdated construction or [townhomes](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin/townhouses). Despite this expensive barrier to entry, Nashville home buyers aren't balking at the cost of living because Franklin is one of the most family-friendly spots around Music City. Even though many houses are on generous lots, quaint parks appear throughout the suburb. Also, Franklin schools, especially the area's Williamson County high schools, are some of the most [highly-rated in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts).  Amenities like these along with a user-friendly downtown have basically made Franklin a prime destination just over 20 minutes from the heart of Nashville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out our neighborhood guide for Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-franklin-tennessee)**\n\n### #4 - Mount Juliet\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Mount Juliet Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Mount_Juliet_acfa57f92c.jpg)\n\nThis once-quiet hamlet, less than 20 miles east of downtown Nashville, has burst onto the Middle Tennessee real estate scene for its accessibility and enchanting location. This \"Land Between the Lakes\" nearly spans the entire area separating Nashville's marquee bodies of water: Old Hickory Lake to the north and Percy Priest Lake to the South. In doing so, the [Mount Juliet](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/mount-juliet) area offers whatever style of lakeside living you can imagine. Still, you don't have to be on the water to see Mount Juliet's considerable appeal. Although the town has been there for decades, recent years have seen something of a real estate renaissance as developers swoop in to build [new construction homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/mount-juliet/new-construction-homes) in an attempt to take advantage of the enthusiasm for the location. This means lots of single-family new construction that caters to–you guessed it–Nashville's large population of growing families. The fact that these homes usually sell for around $400K-$600K illustrates how badly home buyers want access to this community. Great schools, quality restaurants, and a commuter train line that runs daily between Mount Juliet and downtown Nashville are just a few of the features drawing in residents by the thousands. Throw in that the Appalachian Mountains loom just to the east (the town is also known as \"The Gateway to the Blue Ridge\") and you simply have one of the best suburbs that Nashville has to offer.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's all you need to know about Mount Juliet](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-mount-juliet-tennessee)**\n\n### #3 - Spring Hill\n\n![Image of the front of a single family home located in Spring Hill Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Spring_Hill_f6394491c2.jpg)\n\nSince the turn of the century, this suburb nestled in the rolling hills south of Nashville has become one of the area’s most sought-after shelters from big city living.  It’s a haven only a half-hour from downtown that houses over 45,000 residents, most of whom are new arrivals. The vast majority of them are highly educated, white-collar workers living in single-family homes. Many came for the reasonably-priced [new construction](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/spring-hill/new-construction-homes) (around 4 in 5 homes were built since 2000, with more on the way), but what they've found is one of [Nashville's most family-friendly communities](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families). Solid schools and a patchwork of small neighborhood parks meet children's needs, while a developing Main Street restaurant and entertainment scene offer plenty of diversions for adults.  For a change of scenery, [Columbia](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/columbia) to the south and [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin) to the north offer accessible downtown districts without sacrificing that small-town feel. Essentially, Spring Hill boasts a mix of affordability, accessibility, and livability that’s rarely replicated in the Nashville market, which means it’s likely to remain a top suburb for years to come. \n\n**[PRO TIP: Read our neighborhood guide for Spring Hill](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-spring-hill-tennessee)**\n\n### #2 - Thompson's Station\n\nWhile its neighbors, Spring Hill and Franklin, grab the headlines, [Thompson's Station](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/thompsons-station) seems content to sit back and enjoy its rural lifestyle just thirty minutes outside of downtown. The suburb is traditionally home to large houses on even larger lots. And while [new construction](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/thompsons-station/new-construction-homes) development may be breaking these expansive tracts of land into smaller yards, recently-built homes tend to be large, single-family houses. This ensures that Thompson's Station's rural ambiance lives on, even as modern neighborhoods transform it into a coveted locale. Frankly, it's a miracle it took the market this long to catch on to the area. Thompson's Station's lush forests, cascading creeks, and winding backroads are a clean break from the big city bustle. Three large parks run right through the center of town, so access to the area's rustic charms is never far away (locals claim the sunsets at Preservation Park are to die for).  Then, if you need a break from nature, Spring Hill and Franklin are right down the road with all the amenities of a more developed suburb. Whatever your cup of tea, Thompson's Station is undeniably one of the best places to live in the Nashville area, and thanks to recent construction it's also more accessible than ever. Of course, you may just want to build your own country estate here, because there's plenty of undeveloped land to go around. \n\n**[PRO TIP: See what it's like living in Thompson's Station](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-thompsons-station-tennessee)**\n\n### #1 - Brentwood\n\n[Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/brentwood) is another residential gem on the necklace of Nashville suburbs that rest about 15 minutes from downtown. Unlike some other more limited communities, though, Brentwood has the features to serve almost every residential population. Average home prices can be high, well above $700K, but that doesn't mean Brentwood isn't inviting in its own way. There's an energetic, family-friendly feel to the community, with a network of parks, golf courses, an equestrian center, an indoor sports complex, and even a trampoline park. This space for fun and recreation reflects a suburb of Nashville that, for all its luxury, doesn't take itself too seriously. Perhaps that's why young, free-thinking stars like Taylor Swift, Ben Folds, and many country music singers have chosen to call the neighborhood home. Along with these attractions, multiple restaurant districts mean that you'll never have to go downtown to have a good time; and the public schools, Ravenwood High School, in particular, are exemplary. All these features combine to make Brentwood our pick for the top Nashville suburb for day-to-day life, especially for people trying to raise a family. If you want to venture out, though, Brentwood has its advantages as one of the most centrally-located suburbs in the Nashville area. Downtown Franklin is just a ten-minute drive to the south, and many people will happily traverse up the road for a hike at Radnor Lake State Park. Or maybe you just won't leave, because out of all the Music City suburbs, Brentwood might have the most to enjoy.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Here's your guide to living in Brentwood](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-brentwood-tennessee)**\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## 2025 Nashville's Best Suburbs - Honorable Mentions\n\n### Belle Meade\n\nThere's your average swanky suburb....and then there's [Belle Meade](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/belle-meade), historically Nashville's most elite and convenient retreat from the bustling city life. Median home prices are in the multi-million dollar range, but what can you expect from elegant homes perched on sprawling lots only 15 minutes from downtown Nashville. Basically, if you have the means, it's the peak of suburban residential real estate in the area. Technically, Belle Meade is its own incorporated town, with a dedicated police force and city hall, but it still functions as one of the best suburbs in the entire country. First, as the site of one of Nashville's first and largest plantations, it has deep roots in the overall community. What began as an extensive farming operation eventually evolved into a haven for Nashville's patrician class, with the kind of activities and diversions befitting its highbrow clientele. Today the original plantation house, Belle Meade Plantation, is a tourist attraction with an operating vineyard that sees thousands of visitors per year. Just to the south of this National Historic Place are Belle Meade Country Club and Percy Warner Park, the largest park in the city. And if you're hungry, it's even a great place to grab a bite to eat. Restaurants, some of them plenty affordable, line Harding Pike, which borders the community to the west. Many people frequent these spots on the way to the park, and during the drive might send a few envious glances toward perhaps the most distinguished suburb of Nashville.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out what it's like living in Belle Meade](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-belle-meade-in-nashville)**\n\n### East Nashville\n\nWe hesitate to include [East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville) as a true suburb of Nashville because it's just over the Cumberland River from downtown, in about as urban an area as one can find. Neighborhoods there are even old enough that they can be labeled \"Historic\". That being said, we can't just not talk about East Nashville. It's home to some of the city's top cultural spots, with a great music and restaurant scene that centers around 5 Points. And while it may not be Belle Meade as far as lot sizes and elegance, homes are constantly being razed and updated to keep East Nashville one of the top spots in the Nashville area. The cost of living might be a little high, but the culture and convenience can't be beat, which is why after almost 150 years, it's still one of the top places Nashvillians want to live.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Read our neighborhood guide about East Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-east-nashville)**\n\n### Forest Hills\n\n[Forest Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/forest-hills) might not have quite the cache of Belle Meade or the energy of Brentwood, but it still offers huge houses on generous lots, just a few minutes outside the heart of the city. It's not exactly stocked with restaurants and attractions, but the location and properties, alone, justify its inclusion somewhere on this list. Throw in its position between two of Nashville's best parks and Forest Hills is easily one of the best suburbs to live in around the Nashville area.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Check out what it's like living in Forest Hills](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-forest-hills-in-nashville)**\n\n## How Can Felix Homes Help?\n\n[Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is a Nashville-based real estate brokerage servicing middle Tennessee.

Of course, most know it as “Music City”, being the seat of all things country music, but that just scratches the surface of this crazy town. Some call it “The Athens of the South” for its renowned collection of colleges. Partiers love “Nashvegas”, hockey fans yell “Smashville”, but whatever you choose to call it, there’s no question that Nashville is everybody’s destination city—at least, almost everybody’s.\n\nNashville has added around half a million residents in the last decade, and over 15 million visitors walk its streets every year. Basically, it’s in the middle of an unprecedented boom, and while the town’s incomparable music scene, sports teams, and nightlife keep the social calendars full, there’s still one attraction that Nashville would be happy to make room for: a Major League Baseball team. Plans are already in the works to bring Nashville its fourth major sports franchise, The Nashville Stars. Adding this baseball team would be an impressive sign of Nashville’s recent prosperity, but the city isn’t looking for a status symbol. Rather, it’s the logical next step for a baseball-crazed town with deep and meaningful roots in the game.\n\n![Image of a woman singing on a stage at a bar](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Singing_e30a550725.jpg)\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Nashville Baseball: Then And Now\n\nThe MLB may have been founded in 1869, but Nashville was playing ball well before then. The [first official game](https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/baseball/2015/04/15/nashville-professional-baseball-history/25854311/) was reportedly played in the Historic Edgefield neighborhood (when it was just called Edgefield), in 1860. This started a groundswell of enthusiasm for the game, and, unlike the South at the time, baseball was for everyone. Soon Nashville was a destination for the Negro Leagues, with the Standard Giants representing the city in the famed Capitol City League. Some of the country’s greatest baseball players made stops in Nashville, to play the Giants, the Vols (Nashville’s top non-Negro League team), and even—you guessed it—the Stars. This Negro League team that called Nashville home from the 1930s through the 1950s was an important piece of the city’s baseball tradition; repurposing the “Stars” name for the town’s newest franchise serves as an homage to Nashville’s rich and diverse baseball heritage.\n\n[PRO TIP: check out the newest homes listed for sale in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville)\n\n## Why Does A Nashville MLB Team Make Sense?\n\nIndeed, these diverse baseball roots are part of what makes the city so perfect for MLB’s current expansion plans. The Stars would be the [first MLB team named after a Negro League franchise](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/07/07/nashville-stars-mlb-expansion-baseball/5391425002/), and in the last few weeks, Major League Baseball made the long-overdue decision to include Negro League statistics in the MLB record books. Including the Stars would be another way for the league to honor the game’s neglected past while expanding for its future.\n\nThe name, however, doesn’t just pay tribute to the past, it’s also an indication of the kind of people who are passionate about bringing a Major League team to Nashville. We can’t verify this, but we have a feeling it’s the only prospective franchise whose roster of supporters looks like a [CMA after-party guest list](https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/leadership-roster/). The likes of Justin Timberlake, Maren Morris, Darius Rucker, and Eric Church headline a rolodex of celebrity representatives and advisers to the franchise. Tony La Russa, manager of three World Series teams, is at the helm of a star-studded baseball advisory committee, and the Executive Board is chaired by none other than former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Between that all-star leadership and a city that already boasts the third-highest minor league attendance in the country, the Major League has no choice but to take notice.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Is An Expansion Team The Only Avenue For Nashville To Become Host To An MLB Franchise?\n\nMLB expansion is still not a foregone conclusion, but all signs indicate that it’s just a matter of time before Nashville has its own franchise. Although the trials and tribulations of 2020 have gotten in the way of expansion momentum, Nashville still hopes to have a team in town by 2025, and MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has [repeatedly made it clear](https://theathletic.com/2315404/2021/01/11/rosenthal-mlb-expansion-on-hold/) that he thinks it’s time for growth. Even if the league owners don’t vote to expand, franchises like the Oakland As and Tampa Bay Rays could soon be looking for a new home. Either way, Nashville tops the list of potential franchise destinations. The question is, once a team is secured, where will they play, and what will it mean for Nashville’s flourishing real estate market?\n\n## Where Will The Nashville Stars' Stadium Complex Be Built?\n\nFranchise leadership is currently evaluating multiple locations that could house the ballpark complex. The leader in the clubhouse, though, is the parcel of land just across the Cumberland River from downtown, right next to Nissan Stadium. This centrally-located spot would be another boon to the already surging [East Nashville neighborhood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/east-nashville).\n\nPlans indicate that construction would involve much more than just a baseball field. Surrounding the [42,000-seat stadium](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/07/07/nashville-stars-mlb-expansion-baseball/5391425002/), a transformative entertainment and commercial complex would be the crown jewel of Nashville’s recent real estate developments. Swanky office space, upscale condos, a hotel, and shops are all [part of the proposal](https://www.mlbmusiccity.com/), with new parking garages to accommodate the activity. There’s even a plan to transform the stretch of river into Cumberland Cove, a marina and greenway development—think UT’s Vol Navy with a Nashville twist. It would be perhaps Downtown Nashville’s most ambitious real estate project to date and could have dramatic implications for the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n## How Will A New Sports Complex Impact The Surrounding Real Estate Values?\n\nEast Nashville, just across the river from [Downtown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/downtown), is a mostly residential district that has historically provided convenient inner-city residential options. Lately, East Nashville real estate has been on a historic rise. Homes in the district are currently fetching an average of $243 per square foot, making it one of the city’s most expensive areas. Redevelopment efforts usually update or raze older construction, often replace them with large, modern homes carrying million-dollar price tags. All signs suggest that a new East Nashville ballpark would only raise these home values even higher.\n\n### A case study from our neighbors to the south: Atlanta\n\nWhen the Atlanta Braves, the Southeast’s preeminent baseball franchise, announced plans to relocate to a new ballpark just outside of town in Cobb County, [home values quickly responded positively](https://patch.com/georgia/smyrna/suntrust-park-spark-cobb-homes-rise-value-braves-move). Before the park was even built, homes within a two-mile radius of the stadium started selling for an average of 7% more. Once the Braves started playing in their new home, that number jumped to 8.5%. We know, we know, it’s a bit of a stretch to compare real estate trends along a beltway in Northwest Atlanta to those in the heart of Nashville. However, the complex built by the Braves’ development team, complete with chic shops, restaurants, and hotels, mirrors the multi-use super-site envisioned by the Stars’ top brass. With any luck, home values in East Nashville will get something like the “Suntrust Park Spark” enjoyed by surrounding properties in Atlanta.\n\nThe Atlanta stadium real estate bump may not be enough to suggest how a new stadium will affect home values. After all, the Braves are an established franchise relocating to the suburbs—not exactly across the river from Broadway. Fortunately, a recent local example suggests that the same spike in property values will occur. Nashville is currently in the midst of a development frenzy surrounding the construction of Nashville’s new Major League Soccer stadium at the Fairgrounds. Even though the new home for Nashville SC is still under construction, the property gains are already in full swing. \n\n### How did the Nashville SC stadium impact the local real estate market?\n\nThe [Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/wedgewood-houston), just north of the Fairgrounds toward downtown, has seen its average home sale price jump by 13.4% over the past 12 months, to around $590k. The price per square foot on these homes is steep, usually between $260 and $280. Even though the area has some older homes, newer [horizontal property regime](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buying-an-hpr-real-estate) developments, some constructed as a response to the soccer stadium news, are helping to drive prices higher. The Nashville SC complex is relatively close to downtown, in an older residential district, just like the potential East Nashville Stadium. Therefore, it’s likely that the new ballpark would inspire a similar spike in the residential real estate market.\n\n## What Are The Skeptics Saying?\n\nSkeptics of the Stars stadium project argue that East Nashville is so close to the downtown action that a new ballpark won’t make much of a difference in home values. This is a reasonable, but probably unfounded concern. Just because East Nashville is close to downtown doesn’t mean its home values are anywhere near maxed out. Having a baseball stadium close only adds buyer interest, and would likely accelerate the residential property transformations already taking place in the neighborhood. In all likelihood, property values would reach unprecedented heights as people snatched up homes with easy access to 81 Major League Baseball games a year.\n\nStill, nothing is written in stone. The Titans have indicated that [they aren’t thrilled](https://ballparkdigest.com/2020/09/21/stars-titans-disagree-on-potential-ballpark-location/) about these new stadium plans, and alternative building sites are being explored near Tennessee State University and around [Franklin](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/franklin). No matter where the stadium ends up, though, look for the area to become Nashville’s hottest real estate destination.\n\n## Our Conclusion: Nashville Is Built For The MLB\n\nThere’s no question that Nashville deserves a Major League baseball team. It has the history, the leadership, the brand, and the enthusiasm. Sure there are a few things to work out, but as Stars supporter, Maren Morris says, “When the bones are good, the rest don’t matter”. Nashville is built for Major League Baseball, it’s just a matter of time before a team moves in.","description":"Plans are in the works to bring Nashville its fourth major sports franchise, The Nashville Stars.

Or perhaps we should say boots for these two country music hot spots! \n\nAt first glance, the cities are pretty similar. Nashville, Tennessee famously holds the name of Music City and is home to a number of Broadway Honky Tonks and local music venues. Alternatively, Austin, Texas gains recognition for being the music capital of the world. \n\n![Image inside Tootsies honky tonk located in downtown Nashville Tennessee](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Tootsies_d0bfa53eb9.jpg)\n\nIf you're planning to move, the debate between the two is not easy. Nashville takes the lead in our hearts since [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is based here, but we’ll provide an unbiased analysis below so that you can decide.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Comparing The Cost Of Living In Austin vs Nashville\n\nWhen moving, the cost of living is one of the most important factors. The United States national cost of living average is 100. City indexes that score over 100 represent a more expensive cost of living and vice versa. The metric evaluates costs for basic living expenses, such as food, shelter, transportation, and healthcare. Exact expenses may vary due to lifestyle preferences and family size.\n\nAccording to a [2021 study](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/austin_tx/nashville-davidson_tn/costofliving), Austin is 15% more expensive than Nashville. On the surface, that might not sound like a big difference, however, depending on income and spending habits it can add up fast.\n\n### Cost of living in Austin TX\n\n[Sperling’s Best Places](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/austin_tx/nashville-davidson_tn/costofliving) gives the city of Austin an overall cost of living score of 119.3. The makeup of this score looks at food, healthcare, housing, utilities, transportation, and miscellaneous expenditures.\n\nAustin averages 96.7 for food and groceries.

For a fair comparison, we’ll reference the same metrics cited by [Sperling’s](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/austin_tx/nashville-davidson_tn/costofliving) Best Places for Nashville.\n\nGrocery expenses rank slightly higher in Music City, scoring Nashville at 102 for traditional food staples. \n\nNashville healthcare costs measure in at 96.7, roughly 2% higher in comparison to Austin.

The [National Institute of Justice (NIJ)](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crimes/violent-crime) identifies violent crime when a victim is harmed by or threatened with violence. These crimes include robbery, assault, rape, sexual assault, and murder. \n\n[NIJ](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crime/property-crimes) establishes property crime when a victim's property is stolen or destroyed, without force or threat. Property crimes include vandalism, arson, and burglary.\n\nCrime levels within a city lend higher in comparison to most rural towns. Based on [Sperling's 2021 crime comparison](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/austin_tx/nashville-davidson_tn/crime), Austin favors safer for violent crimes, whereas Nashville takes the lead in safety for property crimes.\n\n### Is Nashville a safe city?\n\n[Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States\u0026city1=Austin%2C+TX\u0026country2=United+States\u0026city2=Nashville%2C+TN) notes Nashville's safety score at 52.22. Location plays a factor when evaluating the city's safety metrics. The metropolitan area offers plenty of safe neighborhoods, such as [The Gulch](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/the-gulch), [12 South](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/12-south), and [Germantown](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/neighborhood/tn/nashville/germantown). Alternatively, some areas are still in a transition stage and have a higher crime rate.  If venturing beyond the city center, expect to find several [safe places throughout the state of Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee).\n\n### Is Austin a safe city?\n\nAustin leads on [Numbeo's](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States\u0026city1=Austin%2C+TX\u0026country2=United+States\u0026city2=Nashville%2C+TN) safety scale at 64.13. [Additional sources](https://www.paulypresleyrealty.com/blog/best-neighborhoods-in-austin-which-areas-are-the-safest.html#:~:text=Austin%2C%20Texas%20crime%20rates%20are,safest%20city%20in%20the%20country.) note Austin to be one of the safest places in the United States. Neighborhoods around the University of Texas, Rosendale, and Hyde Park reflect low crime rates. However, although the city has less crime, Austin faces immense backlash for its prevalent homeless population.\n\n## How Big Is Nashville Compared To Austin?\n\nNashville offers more space throughout its city boundaries, measuring approximately 475 square miles. Whereas Austin is made up of 320 square miles. The population of Austin is also denser, equating to 916,906 people. Nashville's total population only amounts to 654,187- based on the 2021 findings conducted by [Sperling's Best Places](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/austin_tx/nashville-davidson_tn/people).\n\n## Where Are The Best Places To Live In Austin vs Nashville?\n\nBoth cities have several desirable neighborhoods.

There are a number of affordable suburbs located on the outskirts of Music City. You can get more bang for your buck on home prices, rent, and overall living expenses. But don’t worry - these suburbs are close enough to the action that you won’t miss a beat! \n\nIn this article, we’re breaking down the most affordable Nashville suburbs. We’ll explore some of the different things to do in each place and help you weigh out the cost-saving benefits. **In this post, we’re specifically focusing on the Nashville suburbs**. If you’re interested in exploring affordable neighborhoods located in Nashville-proper, check out this article we wrote on the [most up-and-coming Nashville neighborhoods](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/up-and-coming-neighborhoods-in-nashville).\n\n**If you're interested in seeing a list of the top 10 most affordable Nashville suburbs, jump to the bottom of this article!**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn order to provide you with the most accurate information, we’ll be analyzing historical data provided from the MLS (Realtracs). The statistics we examined are single-family home sales from the past year in Middle Tennessee. We sorted our findings by location and average sale price, as opposed to the average price per square foot. We felt the average sale price gives a more realistic representation of a location’s affordability.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Track how the Nashville real estate market is doing with our monthly analysis](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-real-estate-market-update)**\n\n## Affordable Things To Do That Won’t Break The Bank\n\nLiving in the suburbs doesn’t mean you’ll have to compromise on having fun. In fact, the cost of fun can even come at a much lower price tag compared to Nashville’s city center. Standard food costs, drinks, and even shopping can run you higher in the metropolitan hub than in many of the surrounding suburbs.  \n\nYou can find plenty of low or no-cost fun activities near the outskirts of Nashville. The surrounding scenery is beautiful. At practically no expense, you can spend a day relaxing and enjoying nature at one of the many parks or lakes. [Beaman Park Nature Center](https://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Nature-Centers-and-Natural-Areas/Beaman-Park-Nature-Center.aspx), [Cheekwood](https://cheekwood.org/), and [Randor Lake](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/radnor-lake) are just a few of the many hidden gems located minutes from Music City.\n\n[The Nashville Zoo](https://www.nashvillezoo.org/) is another great low-cost activity. Daily ticket prices are reasonable, and guests are even welcome to bring in their own food. Also not far from Downtown Nashville is [Arrington Vineyards](https://www.arringtonvineyards.com/), a beautiful wine vineyard situated amongst the rolling green hills. Admission is free and guests can also bring food for a picnic. Mark your calendars for [Music in the Vines](https://www.arringtonvineyards.com/Event-Calendar/Music-in-the-Vines), a free concert that takes place at the vineyard every Saturday and Sunday between the months of April and October.\n\n## Besides The Cost Of Buying A Home, Are There Other Homeownership Costs That Should Be Taken Into Account\n\nNot every suburban location is cheaper than living in the city center. You’ll want to factor in your total expenses before making a final decision. Upfront a low-priced home may seem like a great deal, but you’ll want to always look at the overall picture. \n\nMost Nashville suburbs will require you to have a car, and while this may hold true in the city neighborhoods too, your daily commute will likely increase. Your back and forth drive is an expense you’ll definitely want to consider if you commute downtown.  \n\nYou’ll also want to take into account the costs associated with homeownership. This includes general repair and maintenance costs for the home’s upkeep. Owning a home also means you’re required to pay property taxes. Davidson County recently underwent a [34% increase in property taxes](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/davidson-county-real-estate-tax-hike). \n\nLastly, many of the Nashville suburban homes also fall within an HOA or homeowners association. The responsibilities and benefits of an HOA can vary depending on the area. However, the monthly HOA fees can be hefty and could impact your budget.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Will These Suburbs Remain Affordable\n\nIt would be impossible to guarantee that the current-day affordable Nashville suburbs will continue to remain affordable. As Nashville continues to be the “it” city, it’s likely that prices will rise in many different locations. For now, we’re encouraging those on the hunt for a bargain to capitalize on the deals within these areas now.\n\n## Are These Suburbs Safe\n\nMany of the most affordable Nashville suburbs are also recognized as some of the [safest places to live in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-places-to-live-in-tennessee).  As with any destination, you’ll notice some areas with higher reported crime and some sections with low crime. However, a location’s affordability doesn’t indicate that an area is dangerous, and vice versa. To gain a thorough understanding of an area’s overall safety and reported crime, we recommend checking out [Crime Mapping](https://www.crimemapping.com/map/tn/nashville). \n\n## Why Buying A Home In These Areas Could Be A Great Investment\n\nAs we mentioned before, Nashville’s popularity is on the rise. It’s likely that many of these affordable suburbs will at some point also increase their prices based on the demand. By locking in a home at a low price, you can gain a significant return on your investment. It should also continue to appreciate in value as more people move to Music City, resulting in even more money in your pocket. And, you never know, maybe that suburb will even become the new popular hotspot.\n\n## Some Clarification Is Needed On Our List Below\n\nIt’s important to note, as with any suburb, you’ll find parts that are expensive and parts that are more affordable.

With so much to offer, we don’t anticipate the home prices to stay low for long. \n\n**[PRO TIP: View homes for sale in Goodlettsville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/goodlettsville)**\n\n### 6.

You may be wondering, what does a buyer’s agent do, how much do they cost, and why should I use one?\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Does A Buyer's Agent Do?\n\n### Help you determine your budget\n\nA buyer’s agent’s first goal should be to help you determine your budget. If you are planning on using a mortgage to finance the purchase of your new home, your buyer’s agent should introduce you to a trusted lender who will pre-approve you for financing.\n\n### Narrow down your options\n\nOnce you have a budget in mind and are pre-approved for financing, the next step is to prioritize what you are looking for in a home. Are you interested in a particular number of bedrooms or bathrooms? Do you prefer a certain style of architecture? Are you open to older homes built in previous decades or do you only want to consider homes built in the past 5 years?\n\nAfter these questions are answered, your buyer’s agent should determine what you are looking for in your ideal neighborhood. Do you prefer an urban, suburban, or rural neighborhood? Are you looking for a neighborhood that is [family-friendly](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families) with a great [school district](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts) or are you interested in a neighborhood filled with [young professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals) and great nightlife?\n\nNow that your agent has an idea for your budget and preferences, they will search for available inventory using a system called the Multiple Listing Service or MLS. This system will allow your agent to see all of the available listings currently on the market and help them filter listings that meet your criteria. Your agent will then send you a list of between 10-20 listings that meet most of your preferences. When you review the list of homes, you should keep track of which ones you would like to tour and let your agent know so that they can set up a private showing on your behalf.\n\n### Schedule private showings\n\nYour agent will then accompany you to each private showing and as you are touring the property, a good agent will point out small details you should take note of such as the condition of the HVAC. A good agent will also help you make the right decision. For example, if you have a dog and one of your ‘must-haves’ is a fenced-in yard, don’t get discouraged if a particular home’s yard does not have a fence. Perhaps the home meets all of your other criteria and at the end of the day, adding a fence is a fairly straightforward and inexpensive upgrade you can make if you decide to purchase the home.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Make the best offer\n\nAt this point you’ve found a home that you love! How do you know what price you should offer the seller? What if there are other buyers interested in the property? This is where using a buyer’s agent becomes extremely important. Your agent should first determine what a fair price for the property is, independent of the current list price. They should use recent sales in the neighborhood and choose comparable homes with similar features and characteristics at which point they should determine the average price per square foot of those homes. Making a good offer goes beyond the offer price. Are you offering to pay cash or will there be a financing contingency? Do you include a contingency stating that you must sell your current home first? How are you going to split the closing costs?\n\n### Navigate the closing process\n\nAssuming your offer is accepted, your agent’s final task is to help you through the closing process. They should make sure that the inspection comes back clean and they will work alongside the title company to ensure everything goes off without a hitch.\n\n## How Much Does A Buyer’s Agent Cost?\n\nIn the United States unlike other countries, the buyer’s agent is compensated from the commission that the seller pays. Taking a step back, when you sell your home, traditionally your listing agent would have you sign a listing agreement where the total Realtor commission amounts to 6% of the sales price of the home. This 6% commission is split evenly with 3% going to the listing agent and 3% being offered to a buyer’s agent to incentivize them to bring their clients to the listing. This means that as a buyer, there is no out-of-pocket cost to using a buyer’s agent to help you through the process.\n\n## Why Should You Use A Buyer’s Agent?\n\nUsing a buyer’s agent is important because the stakes are so high. For most families, purchasing a home is their single largest investment and while hiring a Realtor who is a friend of the family can seem like a good idea, it’s important to make sure they are experienced. We suggest hiring an agent who has successfully completed at least 15 transactions in the past 12 months.\n\nWe also advocate interviewing multiple agents so that you can get an idea for what services they offer. For example, while nearly all agents will have access to the same inventory via the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), some firms, such as Felix Homes, offer a free moving service so that you don’t have to go through the hassle of hiring a moving company or, even worse, taking the DIY approach.","published_at":"2020-08-21T06:10:56.876Z","createdAt":"2020-08-21T06:10:15.232Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-26T21:25:23.800Z","__v":0,"image":{"_id":"5fc87554d709430017690bcc","name":"buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","alternativeText":"An image of a young couple and their daughter moving into their new home","caption":"","hash":"buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":90.04,"width":1200,"height":686,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":140,"size":8.83,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"large_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":572,"size":69.7,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/large_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"medium_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":429,"size":46.52,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"small_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":286,"size":25.49,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/small_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"}},"provider":"aws-s3","related":["5fc88147d709430017690bcd"],"createdAt":"2020-12-03T05:19:16.232Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-25T17:30:24.649Z","__v":0,"id":"5fc87554d709430017690bcc"},"postCategory":"601353b6d634cd92400d8630","locationGroup1":[],"locationGroup2":[],"locationGroup10":[],"locationGroup11":[],"locationGroup12":[],"locationGroup13":[],"locationGroup14":[],"locationGroup15":[],"locationGroup3":[],"locationGroup4":[],"locationGroup5":[],"locationGroup6":[],"locationGroup7":[],"locationGroup8":[],"locationGroup9":[],"name":"How does a buyer's agent get paid","faq":{"content":[{"question":"What is a buyer's agent and what do they do?","answer":"A buyer's agent is a real estate professional who helps homebuyers navigate the home buying process.

When selecting a buyer’s agent to work with, you’ll want to be sure to verify their experience and background.\n\nIn most industries, one’s experience level implies a long tenure within the business. However, in real estate, an agent’s expertise is not always determined by the number of years in practice. A true representation of their level of skill derives from the volume of completed real estate transactions, not by the number of years worked. \n\nMost agents close roughly 3-5 transactions per year. However, at Felix Homes, our agents complete between 3-5 transactions each month! Due to the significant increase in deals, our agents gain more exposure and experience to unique situations. Also, they can quickly spot costly mistakes that other agents could easily fail to see. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Why It's Important To Choose The Right Real Estate Buyer's Agent\n\n### Give you insight into the neighborhood\n\nAn agent with experience will know the ins and outs of different neighborhoods. Purchasing a home is an investment, and you’ll want to be sure the surrounding neighborhood doesn’t have a negative trajectory. A buyer’s agent can provide insight into community associations, [top-performing schools](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts), and the [level of crime](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-neighborhoods-in-nashville) within a designated area. They can also point you in the right direction for a location suitable for [young professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals), [families](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families), or [senior living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee).\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the best places to live in Nashville for families](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families)**\n\n### Help you find ‘coming soon’ or ‘off-market’ properties\n\nOnline listing platforms, such as the multiple listing service (MLS), showcase the majority of the available inventory. However, a great buyer’s agent is also on the hunt for “coming soon” or “off-market” properties. These homes have yet to hit the market and provide the client with a leg up on a potential listing. An experienced agent will often leverage various networking channels, such as Facebook groups, to gain access to future listings.\n\n### Help you make the most competitive offer on a home\n\nMaking an offer on a home you love is exciting but also brings on a lot of nerves. Especially if the market is competitive or favors the sellers, the right offer can have a huge impact. Making a strong and favorable initial offer could dictate if you succeed or miss out on the home of your dreams. A great agent guides you throughout the process and helps you stand out from the rest. Additionally, an experienced buyer’s agent knows the tips for winning in a competitive bidding war. They can guide you through which contingencies to include and how you can make your offer more appealing by including items such as a pre-approval letter from a trusted lender, and even a personal letter to the sellers.\n\n### Help you negotiate the best offer and terms\n\nA great buyer’s agent doesn’t have a mediocre approach to negotiation. Instead, they strive to finalize the deal with the best terms for their client. An agent with experience provides insight on a recommended offer price taking into account the current market demands. Agents will typically summarize this information in a [comparative market analysis (CMA) report](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/comparative-market-analysis). If the list price is too high, the agent negotiates on the client’s behalf to achieve a fair price.  Additionally, the agent will negotiate the terms of the contract, along with important contingencies to protect the buyer. This can include a home warranty, negotiating the closing costs, or allowing the buyer early occupancy of the property. \n\n### Make sure you are legally protected\n\nBeyond the house-hunting and negotiation portion, a buyer’s agent also ensures you are legally protected in the purchase. This is crucial because, believe it or not, when buying a home a lot can go wrong. If concerns arise from the home inspection, a good agent knows how to get your earnest money back. Additionally, in the event of unforeseen financial mishaps, an experienced buyer’s agent steps in to assist with further negotiation or to void the contract.\n\n## How Has The Job Of A Real Estate Buyer’s Agent Gotten More Efficient\n\n### 99% of real estate inventory is online\n\nIn today’s world, almost everything operates in some capacity online, and that goes the same for real estate. Whereas previously agents carried around physical binders of active listings, now with the online MLS, all of the inventory is available in real-time. Potential homebuyers can filter through the listings right from the comfort of their own homes. This allows the buyer to browse and select their own listings, and leverage the agent to set the private tour.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Set up your custom feed so that you never miss a new listing](https://www.felixhomes.com/feed)**\n\n### Electronic signature platforms\n\nWith the help of electronic signature platforms, real estate deals can advance in a fraction of the time. Now, an agent can forgo needing to travel and meet a client in person to obtain a signature on a contract or document. This is a tremendous benefit for expediting processes more efficiently in the real estate industry. Additionally, e-signature platforms minimize potential risks by securely transferring documents or contracts.\n\n## Since A Buyer’s Agent's Job Has Gotten More Efficient, Why Do They Still Make Such A Large Commission\n\nA buyer’s agent receives a commission payout from the [seller’s closing costs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/a-definitive-guide-to-closing-costs). Traditionally, that percentage falls somewhere between 2.5% and 3% of the final sale price. Although the commission is technically [paid by the seller](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/how-does-a-buyers-agent-get-paid), an agent factors in the commission payout when determining the listing price.\n\nWith the technology at our fingertips, more times than not, the homebuyer is the one actually finding the home. Don’t get us wrong, a buyer’s agent still plays an important role in other key aspects, such as negotiation and legality. However, since the traditional role of a buyer’s agent has since evolved, shouldn’t the fees follow? \n\nThis has led to a common practice known as a [buyer’s agent commission rebate](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee).\n\n## What's A Buyer’s Agent Commission Rebate?\n\nIn simple terms, a buyer’s agent commission rebate is like the 'cash back' you get from using a credit card. There’s a bit more to the concept, but it occurs when a buyer’s agent gives a portion of their commission to the buyer. The amount can be a percentage or a defined dollar amount. The notion of a commission rebate has become increasingly popular in several states. However, the state of Tennessee has made this practice illegal. \n\nTennessee is one of only 10 states that considers a buyer’s rebate illegal. Not to worry, at Felix Homes, not only are we fighting against the outlaw, but we are the [only brokerage that has found a legal workaround](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee). Under federal law, real estate commissions must be negotiable. Therefore, whenever we make an offer for one of our buyer’s we reduce our commission that the seller pays to only 2%. Then, included within the contract is a stipulation that the seller must contribute 1% of the final sales price towards the buyer's closing costs.\n\nThis concept is one of the many unique factors that make Felix Homes Nashville's most financially responsible way to buy or sell a home.","author":"Felix Homes","slug":"how-to-choose-a-top-real-estate-buyers-agent","title":"How To Choose A Top Real Estate Agent (Buyer's Agent) In Nashville","isFeatured":false,"description":"Thinking of buying a home?

In reality, a Realtor can be an invaluable asset and keep you on track from start to finish. But who pays who? How does a Realtor get paid on a new construction home if there's not a traditional seller on the other side?\n\nDon't worry; we did all the research to make the journey as transparent and easy as possible. Here's what to know and how to get started.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Realtors are paid by the seller (the home builder) on the closing day.\n- You’ll get help on everything from [understanding the new construction process](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/first-time-home-buyer-new-construction) to negotiating the price with a knowledgeable Realtor by your side.\n- It’s not in your best interest to rely on the builder for information or use the builder’s sales agent as your own.\n- Realtors only get paid if the sale closes successfully. If you do not close on the home, you do not have to pay your Realtor.\n- By using Felix as your buyer's agent, you can save up to 1% off the sales price thanks to our [Buyer's Savings Program](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee).\n\n\n## What’s The Difference: Broker vs Agent vs Realtor\n\n- Broker: Licensed brokers can run their own real estate brokerage and hire agents.\n- Agent: Real estate agents are also licensed professionals but must work under a licensed broker.\n- Realtor: Realtors belong to a trade group called the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\n## Who Is Involved In The New Construction Sales Process?\n\nThere are several parties involved in the sale of a new construction home, so let’s take a look at what to expect from the buyer’s and seller’s side.\n\n### The Buyer’s Side\n\n- Buyer: The buyer is a person (or several people) buying a new construction home or an existing property. \n- Buyer’s Agent: Buyer's agents are real estate agents, Realtors, or brokers who are legally and ethically required to look out for your best interest when helping you buy a property.\n- Buyer’s Closing Company: A closing company is usually referred to as a title company and handles your escrow and closing matters.\n- Buyer’s Lender: The buyer's lender is the financial institution, like a bank or credit union, that gives you a mortgage for a house or new build.\n\n\n### The Seller’s Side\n\n- Seller / Builder: When you buy a new construction home, the builder is also typically the seller.\n- Builder’s Sales Agent: A builder's agent represents the builder during the entire sales process. You could also use the term “seller’s agent” instead.\n- Builder’s Closing Company: Just like on the buyer’s side, the closing company is a title company and attorneys that help close the sale. \n\n\n## Who Pays The Buyer’s Agent Commission When Buying New Construction?\n\n![Real estate agent talking on cell phone.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_2_d15c9c4a7e_2f9d2a235b.png)\n\nIf you’re nervous about paying a Realtor’s commission out of pocket when buying new construction, don’t worry. The [buyer’s agent commission](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/how-does-a-buyers-agent-get-paid) comes from the seller, which is typically the home builder in the case of a new construction home purchase. It also works the same way whether you choose to buy a new construction home or an existing home. But if you don’t end up buying the home, you won’t owe a dime. The agent fees are only paid if the transaction closes. When you use Felix as your buyer's agent, we reduce the commission we get from the builder so that you can save on the sales price.\n\n## Benefits Of Using A Buyer’s Agent In A New Construction Transaction\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to [use a buyer’s agent during a new construction transaction](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/do-you-need-a-realtor-for-new-construction). Here’s how they help make it as seamless as possible.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Help you get pre-approved with a lender\n\nHome builders usually work with a preferred lender. That said, you can use whoever you want, but the preferred lender may pass on perks to the buyer, like a credit towards your closing costs. Agents are also familiar with local lenders in their area and which lender may serve you the best. For example, some lenders specialize in working with first-time home buyers, veterans, investment buyers, or self-employed professionals. Your agent can also help determine how much of a down payment you will need for the loan type you decide to choose.\n\n### Help determine what you’re looking for in a home\n\n![Real estate agent showing his clients around a home](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_3_0683e17659_a9cb705847.png)\n\nSome new construction homes look like carbon copies of each other, and others offer a dozen unique floor plans to choose from. Sometimes you can even customize features like cabinet colors, flooring, and kitchen upgrades. Buyer’s agents can help narrow down all your options to find your dream home. They’ll help you come up with a wish list and know which builders can deliver on your vision.\n\n### Help you find the perfect location\n\nYou’re wise to team up with a buyer's agent who is a local expert. Whether you’re thinking about schools or a home with a view, they intimately know the area and which locations are perfect for your lifestyle.\n\n### Vet local builders\n\nIf you’re house hunting in an area that’s booming with development, you'll find several builders to choose from. Unfortunately, not all builders celebrate high-quality craftsmanship and customer service. A local real estate agent will know [which builders are worth working with](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-custom-home-builders-tennessee) and will give you insight into their reputation.\n\n### Negotiate the terms of the purchase on your behalf\n\nNew construction homes come with a base price, but that doesn’t mean there’s no room to [negotiate with the builder](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/negotiate-with-the-builder-when-buying-a-new-construction-house). Realtors help with the terms of your sale to get you the best terms possible. Even if you can’t get the sales price any lower, your agent can help negotiate lower closing costs, a better home warranty, or upgrade discounts.\n\n### Educate you on the build process\n\nWhether you’re a first-time home buyer or a seasoned pro, you need someone to keep you up to date on the building process. Builders and their sales teams aren’t always known for their robust communication. They’re busy serving multiple customers and building homes, leaving you waiting for more info. Realtors know what delays are normal, like weather and supply chain issues, and which need a follow-up with the builder. Your agent stays in touch with the builder, educates you on the process, and intervenes if there’s a problem or if deadlines are getting missed.\n\n### Work with your lender on your loan application\n\nLoan applications feel like they take forever to complete, and the process is not over once you submit your initial application. You’ll need to provide proof of income, tax returns, and other required documentation. Buyer’s agents know the process inside and out and stay in touch with your lender on what’s needed and when. You’ll stay organized and on track without worrying about making a mistake.\n\n### Monitor the construction progress\n\n![Image of a home builder working on the framing of a new home](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_4_5fad01811d_ce5992b12b.png)\n\nEven if you already live in the area you’re buying a new construction home in, there's no way to hang around and check the progress all the time. Life gets busy and you’ll quickly learn there are dead periods where it seems like little progress is being made. Builders must secure permits, schedule their crew, and figure out their materials before anything happens on your lot.\n\nBuyers’ agents stay on top of the construction process and keep you sane. They let you know what to expect and make you aware of any delays which could impact your closing date estimate. Their input is especially important if you’re waiting to list your current home or if you need to negotiate a short-term rental.\n\n### Help sell your current home if you have one\n\nIt can be beneficial to use the same agent to buy your new construction home and list your current one. They’ll have more insight into the sales price you need to secure and when to list it to coincide with the completion of your new build. Agents also have experience dealing with unexpected issues. For example, if the new construction is facing delays, your agent can help you explore renting back the current home you're selling for a brief period. Felix can not only help you save when you purchase a new home. We're committed to lower commission fees and [only charge 1.5% to list with us](https://www.felixhomes.com/sell). Past sellers have saved $12,375 in commission fees on average which can go a long way if you decide to make upgrades to your new build!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Schedule your inspections\n\nYou'll need a [home inspection](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/new-construction-inspection) to make sure your new build is ready to go. But unlike a traditional home sale, you probably need a few different types of home inspections for a new build. You may decide to have a pre-pour inspection before the foundation is set. It's also normal to have a pre-drywall inspection and a blue-tape inspection to sign off on the completed work.\n\n### Help you avoid making a mistake\n\nThere are endless details to consider when buying a new construction home, and it's easy to make a mistake. Agents understand the process and what to look for before you lock in the deal. They may know to ask about issues on your lot, like where utilities will lie before the build starts or negotiate an included termite bond.\n\nBuyer’s agents are also experts at thinking through all of the details. From backsplashes to countertops, they’ll know what trends hold their value and how to plan.\n\n## Can I Use The Builder’s Sales Agent As My Realtor?\n\nSome buyers think it’s easier to just use the builder’s sales agent to represent them during the sale, but it’s just not a good idea. The listing agent represents the builder’s interests. They’re unlikely to advocate on your behalf if an issue pops up. They also won’t help you negotiate a better purchase price. At the end of the day, the builder is their client.\n\n### What Is Dual Agency?\n\nSome brokerages represent both the home seller and the buyer in a real estate transaction. This is referred to as a dual agency and it’s not usually a good idea. In the context of new construction, if you decide to use the builder’s sales agent, they have an inherent conflict of interest working with you as the buyer. They can’t remain impartial and best serve you if you’re unhappy with the negotiations or construction process. \n\n## Will The Builder Give Me A Better Price If I Don’t Have An Agent?\n\nSure, it would be nice to save some extra money, but forgoing a Realtor isn’t the way to do it. Builders won’t pass on the savings or give you a better price if you decide to work directly with their sales team during the home buying process. If anything, you’re more likely to get a better deal on the home and potential upgrades when working with a Realtor.\n\nOne way to save some extra money when purchasing a new or existing home is by having a Felix represent you as your buyer's agent. At Felix, we reduce our commission so that you can save on the sales price.\n\n## What’s A Procuring Cause?\n\nHave you seen the term “procuring cause” somewhere in a new home contract? These indicate a real estate agent’s actions that successfully result in a sale. Why does it matter? It all comes down to who earns the commission for the property. \n\nSometimes the procuring cause comes into question if one Realtor introduced you to the property, another met you at an open house, and yet another offered to help you write an offer on the property. Things can get messy quickly and potentially hold up your sales transaction. You can avoid problems by always being upfront. Tell your real estate agent if you're already working with another professional.\n\n## Should I Sign A Buyer Representation Agreement?\n\n![Image of a person signing a document.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_5_14841f82d0_873dd0ff2e.png)\n\nIt can be good to sign a buyer's representation agreement, depending on how it’s structured. The agreement helps clarify the process, the Realtor’s responsibilities to you, and defines all of the expectations on both sides. Agents want to make sure you won’t suddenly decide to work with someone else after investing time into helping you as a client.\n\nThere are tons of benefits for the Realtor in these agreements, but buyers get some peace of mind too. For starters, the agent is now responsible for the work that they promise to provide. It also means you are their top priority. \n\nDespite some of the perks, you don't have to sign a buyer representation agreement if you’re uncomfortable with it. If you want more flexibility, you can also ask for an agreement with an expiration date or one that only covers a specific property or geographic location.\n\n## How Much Is The Buyer’s Agent Commission?\n\nThe total real estate commission the seller typically pays is 6% of the home's sale price. The buyer's agent usually receives half the total commission or 3%. These figures hold true whether you’re buying new construction or a resale property.\n\nA buyer’s agent commission might vary by location or builder, but remember, you won’t need to worry about the cost. The seller is responsible for the commission.\n\n## When Does The Buyer’s Agent Get Paid With New Construction?\n\nA buyer’s agent gets paid a commission on closing day. At this point, the construction would have been completed allowing you to close on the property. This ends up being beneficial for buyers and sellers alike since the seller only pays a commission for a successful outcome. After all, the Realtor is going to stay invested in the process and work on your behalf until you have the keys to your new home.\n\n## Is A Buyer’s Agent Allowed To Offer A Commission Rebate?\n\nA commission rebate is money that your agent refunds you at closing. It's a way to sweeten the deal and secure your business, but there are limitations. A buyer's agent can only agree to offer a rebate if state law allows it. Currently, 40 out of 50 states allow commission rebates. There are 10 states where offering a commission rebate is actually illegal. [Learn how to get a commission rebate in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee)!\n\n## Tips For Finding The Best Real Estate Agent\n\n[Choosing the right Realtor](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-top-real-estate-buyers-agent) is essential to a positive home buying experience. Referrals can be helpful, but every purchase is unique, especially when it comes to new construction builds or the purchase of model homes. Yet going online for reviews can also pose issues. Builders generally don't upload all of their available inventory to sites like Zillow and the MLS. Withholding their available listings makes their inventory seem lower and more in demand than it really is. \n\nNow that you know everything about how Realtors get paid on a new construction home, you’re ready to start house hunting.

Felix Homes has found a legal way to offer buyers a way to save by reducing the buyer’s agent commission we receive and asking for a reduction in the sales price to reflect this savings.\n- **Technology has significantly reduced the workload of buyer’s agents**, making the traditional commission structure appear outdated and paving the way for rebates and lower commissions.\n- **Despite the technological advances**, using a buyer's agent is still valuable for the expertise and negotiation skills they bring to the table.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nAt Felix Homes, we proudly offer what we like to call our [Buyer Savings Program](https://www.felixhomes.com/save). This solution provides significant savings to home buyers, challenging the traditional 6% commission structure. We leverage technology to offer lower commission fees, and make the case that the traditional 3% buyer’s agent commission is outdated. While we acknowledge the value of professional guidance in the home buying process, we encourage homebuyers to negotiate commission rates and take advantage of rebates, where legal, to save on the largest investment most people will make.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Does Felix Homes Offer A Buyer Rebate In Tennessee?\n\nWe believe the Tennessee law making it illegal to give a commission rebate is absolutely crazy! Let’s face it, buying a home is expensive, and many folks save up for years just to have enough money to afford a home. Not only that, commission rebates are legal in 40 out of 50 states.\n\nIn Tennessee, instead of offering a cash-back style rebate, our process looks a little different but most importantly – the savings our clients receive are the same! \n\n**Instead of requiring the seller to pay a full 3% commission fee when we represent a buyer, we ask for just 2%**. Since we are reducing our commission, we include language in all of our offers stating that this difference, typically 1%, must be paid by the seller towards the buyer's closing costs. \n\nIn practice, this achieves the same thing as a traditional commission rebate. If you plan on purchasing a home for $700,000, you could end up saving $7,000 off your closing costs. I don't know about you, but that's meaningful savings. This is a loophole in the law that is completely legal and **we're the only brokerage in Tennessee that does it**!\n\n## What Is A Buyer Agent Commission?\n\nA buyer’s agent commission is the amount of compensation an agent receives for representing the buyer in a transaction. This amount has historically been 3% of the sales price. In most cases, the buyer’s agent is only entitled to a commission if the transaction closes. \n\nIn Tennessee, the buyer agent commission is typically 2.5% - 3% of the sales price. Considering how the internet has allowed homebuyers to do much of the home searching themselves, the [3% commission seems drastically inflated](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/low-commission-real-estate-agents-nashville), right?\n\n## Who Pays The Buyer Agent Commission?\n\nAny rational person would suggest that the seller would pay for the listing agent commission, and the buyer pays the buyer agent commission. This is a big misconception. Historically, the home seller is responsible for paying the agent commission for both the buyer and seller!\n\nOn average, this is a total of 6% of the purchase price in commission fees the seller ends up paying. The buyer's agent gets a 3% fee, and the listing agent would get a 3% fee. On a $700,000 home, that is $42,000 in realtor commission fees. That's a lot of money by any standards.\n\nJust because the buyer does not have to pay out of pocket to use the services of a buyer's agent doesn't mean it is free. A simple economics course would teach you that the buyer's agent commission is factored into the sales price. This is why so many buyers attempt to bypass the services of an agent to get a better price. Luckily, with a home buyer rebate, buyers can have their cake and eat it too by both saving money thanks to the commission rebate and also benefitting from the experience of a licensed agent.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is A Home Buyer Rebate?\n\nA home buyer rebate is when a buyer's agent gives their client back a portion of their commission they receive from the seller. Think of a commission rebate like cash back on a credit card. For instance, if a buyer's agent collected a 3% commission, or $21,000, they may elect to keep $14,000 of that commission and give their client a commission rebate of $7,000. \n\nA Realtor may decide to do this as a token of appreciation, a simple thank you, or as a way to get more clients! Commission rebates allow agents to compete for a buyer's business, not just on the level of service they provide but also the price they charge for that service. It's a win-win!\n\nThe concept of a buyer's commission rebate has become increasingly popular in recent years as buyers understand that they take on more of the legwork in the home search process. Buyers also understand that as home prices continue to appreciate, a 3% commission on a $100,000 home in 1980 is a lot less than a 3% commission on a $700,000 home today.\n\n## What Value Does A Buyer Agent Offer?\n\nAs unconventional as this may sound, the reality is, when it comes to being a real estate agent, a buyer's agent's job has drastically changed since the adoption of the internet.\n\n### What Did A Buyer's Agent Do Before The Internet?\n\nRewind the clock 15 or 20 years, and yes, these agents had their hands full discovering new inventory and manually coordinating when to physically tour homes. They would literally carry around a big binder filled with properties listed for sale. Nothing was online so if a home buyer wanted to see what inventory was available, they would first call their Realtor who would manually look through their binder and pick a few properties that met the buyer's needs.\n\nIf the buyer was then interested in making an offer on the property, doing a [comparable market analysis](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/comparative-market-analysis) wasn't as easy as it is today. Their agent would have to seek out all of the recent comps in their binder to manually compute their opinion of the [home's value](https://www.felixhomes.com/how-much-is-my-house-worth). These old-school agents didn't even have electronic signature software so every time a document needed to be signed by their client, they had to hop in their car and drive over to their client. All this time-consuming work meant that buyer agent commission rebates were never brought up until the advent of technology caused a huge shift in the industry.\n\n### How Did Technology Make The Job Of A Buyer Agent More Efficient?\n\nIn today's technological age, so much of these manual buyer agent tasks can be accomplished with the click of a mouse, or simply by scrolling on your phone. The internet and apps allow the home buyer to do most of the legwork! Buyers are able to preselect their 'requirements', and the [home-search website](https://www.felixhomes.com/feed) will automatically show them homes in their desired area that meet these requirements.\n\nIf you want 4 bedrooms, there's a filter for that. If you need a two-car garage, there is a filter for that too. All you need to do is ask your Realtor to unlock the front door so you can see if the pictures live up to the hype! If you're interested in making an offer on a home, your agent can easily do a comparable market analysis to determine what a fair price for the home should be. There is no longer the need to manually compute these critical numbers! **No wonder buyers are increasingly asking their agent for a rebate.**\n\n## Should You Use A Buyer Agent Or Represent Yourself?\n\nUsing a buyer’s agent is a valuable asset and we encourage you to work with one. After all, purchasing a home may be the largest investment you make. \n\nIt's a good idea to have a professional in your corner to help answer any of the questions you may have and help you negotiate the purchase. \n\nBut the reality is, in today's technology-driven world, buyer's agents are just not worth 3% of the final sales price. This is why many folks are starting to ask for a home buyer rebate from real estate agents.\n\nIs It Legal For Real Estate Agents To Give Part Of Their Commission To Buyers In Tennessee?\n\nTennessee is one of 10 states that makes it illegal for an agent to give a buyer rebate. As crazy as this sounds, it's the absolute truth. According to the [Tennessee Real Estate Commission (TREC)](https://www.tn.gov/commerce/regboards/trec.html) and the [Tennessee Association of Realtors](https://tnrealtors.com/), an agent is not allowed to give a commission rebate to their client nor are they allowed to directly pay for their client's closing costs. At Felix Homes, we are actively working on fighting for a change to this outdated law by starting a [petition](http://chng.it/mQLpfG5tDV) that we encourage you to sign.\n\n## **What States Do Not Allow A Buyer Agent Rebate?**\n\nAs crazy as this sounds, there are still 10 states where it is illegal for an agent to give their client a commission rebate. \n\n- Alaska\n- Alabama\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Louisiana\n- Missouri\n- Mississippi\n- Oklahoma\n- Oregon\n- Tennessee\n\n![Infographic showing the states where a buyer agent commission rebate is legal.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Buyer_Commission_Reabte_Infographic_3b96ebfe26.svg)\n\nAlthough it's not legal for an agent to give part of their commission to the buyer in Tennessee, the commission rate can still be [negotiated](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/are-realtor-commissions-negotiable). There is no law mandating that the buyer's agent must take 3% of the purchase price as their commission. \n\nAs a buyer, you should certainly ask your agent to take a lower commission which can make your offer look more appealing to a home seller. While it's not exactly the same as getting cash back on your home purchase, asking your buyer's agent to reduce their commission is in effect the same as a commission rebate.\n\n## How Can Felix Homes Help?\n\nFelix Homes is a [low-commission real estate brokerage](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/low-commission-real-estate-agents-nashville). We work with both [buyers](https://www.felixhomes.com/buy) and [sellers](https://www.felixhomes.com/sell) and help keep more profit in your pocket on each real estate transaction.\n\nNot only do we charge a lower commission on the buy side, we charge a flat [1.5% commission fee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/one-and-a-half-percent-commission-realtor-nashville) when we sell a home for our clients. On average, we help our clients save $12,375 when they choose to list their home with Felix. Our clients are able to save on commissions and use that cash for other important expenses such as a home renovation, family vacation, or downpayment on their dream home!\n\n## How Do We Charge Lower Commission Fees?\n\nThis is such a common question, and we love answering it! The fact of the matter is, we believe technology changed the real estate industry, but traditional Realtors are holding onto a higher commission fee for obvious reasons. Many years ago, paying a 6% commission fee may have been appropriate, but in today's world with all the real estate apps, online photos, home search websites, and virtual tours, that fee is no longer needed.\n\nIn addition, the average home price has skyrocketed. Commissions on a $700,000 are a lot more than what they would be on a $100,000 home. The 6% commission rate has stayed relatively unchanged, but all the variables that make up the rate (effort and price) have changed!\n\n## Our Final Thoughts On Buyer Rebates\n\nIn wrapping up our discussion on buyer agent commission rebates, it's clear that the landscape of real estate transactions is evolving, with technology at the forefront of this change. Felix Homes stands committed to adapting to these changes, offering buyer rebates as a testament to our belief in fair and transparent pricing. \n\nWe understand the significance of purchasing a home and strive to make this process as beneficial as possible for our clients. Our approach is rooted in the value we see in every home buyer's journey — empowering them with savings that extend beyond the transaction. In a market where every dollar counts, Felix Homes is proud to lead the charge in offering a financially savvy pathway to home ownership, ensuring our clients don't just find their dream home but also retain more of their hard-earned money in the process.","published_at":"2020-12-09T18:10:48.376Z","createdAt":"2020-12-09T17:14:00.767Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-26T21:25:23.807Z","__v":0,"image":{"_id":"6601a49ca16a8b00168b3540","name":"Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Tennessee.png","alternativeText":"Image of a home living room with an envelope with cash inside in the middle.","caption":"","hash":"Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":5468.27,"width":5760,"height":3772,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312.png","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Tennessee.png","hash":"thumbnail_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":238,"height":156,"size":115.65,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312.png"},"large":{"name":"large_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Tennessee.png","hash":"large_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":1000,"height":655,"size":1703.98,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/large_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Tennessee.png","hash":"medium_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":491,"size":1010.22,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Buyer Agent Commission Rebate In Tennessee.png","hash":"small_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":327,"size":471.08,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/small_Buyer_Agent_Commission_Rebate_In_Tennessee_0cf8522312.png"}},"provider":"aws-s3","related":["5fd105d88ba5df0017b90ae7"],"createdAt":"2024-03-25T16:21:48.564Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-25T16:22:48.798Z","__v":0,"id":"6601a49ca16a8b00168b3540"},"description":"Tennessee is 1 of 10 states that makes it illegal for a buyer's agent to refund their client any part of their commission.

In particular, closing costs like title insurance and home inspection fees get a lot of attention, and for good reason. The [average homebuyer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingcosts.asp) in the U.S. pays $4,876 in closing costs. While it’s important to be aware of closing costs, the largest cost associated with any real estate transaction is the commissions paid to the real estate agents. Many people believe realtor commissions are set in stone. What your realtor does not want you to know is that these commissions are negotiable.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Standard Real Estate Commission?\n\nReal estate agents get paid a commission when the sale of a home is finalized. Typically, this commission is **6% of the sale price** of the home. This commission is paid to the agent representing the seller, who then splits the commission with the agent representing the buyer.\n\nThe realtor commissions on the sale of a $500,000 house would typically be $30,000. This $30,000 comes off the $500,000 sale price leaving the seller with $470,000 after commissions are accounted for.\n\nSince the commission is taken from the sale price of the home there is a common belief that the seller pays the full cost. However, realtor commissions are factored into the sale price of a home. This drives up the price that the buyer must pay for the home. In this way, buyers indirectly pay for realtor fees even if it is the seller who signs the check.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Learn about buyers agent commission rebate in Tennessee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee)**\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Realtor Fees Rise With Home Prices\n\nSince most realtors collect a 6% commission, their compensation rises and falls with the price of real estate. As you are probably aware real estate prices have been rising dramatically over the past 10 years in Middle Tennessee. The hotter the market, the more you pay in realtor fees.\n\nIf you bought a house in Nashville in 2012 you would have paid about $10,000 in realtor commissions on average. If you sold that same house today, you would pay nearly $21,000 in realtor commissions. **The realtor does the same amount of work on the deal today as they did in 2012, but they collect over twice the commission**.\n\nIf you are happy paying that amount of commission when you buy or sell a house, then read no further. If you want to discover an easy way to save thousands of dollars in realtor commissions, keep reading.\n\n## Real Estate Commissions Are Negotiable\n\nThe standard 6% commission has become so ingrained in society that many people believe that there is some sort of law mandating a 6% commission fee. This is not true! No law says that real estate commissions need to be 6% of the selling price. All real estate commissions are negotiable.\n\nJust because realtor fees are negotiable does not mean realtors are compelled to lower their commission below 6%. **It is your legal right to ask a real estate agent to lower their commission**. The realtor is free to refuse your request–which most do.\n\n## Are there any other options?\n\nA model that is quickly gaining popularity is the [1.5% commission](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/one-and-a-half-percent-commission-realtor-nashville). Under this model, the listing agent only charges a 1.5% commission fee instead of the typical 3%. With the 1.5% model, it is still recommended that you offer a buyer’s agent a commission to incentivize them to show your home to their clients.\n\nThis model is made possible due to technology which has made the job of a real estate agent much easier and more efficient. Since technology has made the listing process more efficient, many real estate firms are passing their savings onto the consumer. The firms that offer these discounted rates are commonly revered to as [low commission real estate agents](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/low-commission-real-estate-agents-nashville).\n\n## How Much Can You Save With The 1.5% Model?\n\nLet’s say you wanted to sell your house for $500,000. If you used a real estate agent at a traditional brokerage, you would pay $30,000 ($500,000 X 6%). This $30,000 would then be split between the listing agent and the buyer’s agent.\n\nIf instead, you decided to use [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/), you would pay $22,500 ($500,000 X 4.5%). Of this $22,500, $7,500 would be paid to Felix Homes and $15,000 would be offered to a buyer’s agent. **By using Felix Homes, you would save $7,500.**\n\n**[PRO TIP: Compare services - 1.5% agent vs 3% agent](https://www.felixhomes.com/resources/traditional-vs-low-commission-agent)**\n\n## What Could You Buy With $10,000?\n\nIf you want to have your mind blown, consider this. **If you took $10,000 and invested it, after 30 years you would have more than $100,000** assuming an 8% average rate of return on your investment. If you don’t think that is a life-changing amount of money, consider the fact that the [average 401k balance](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/010616/whats-average-401k-balance-age.asp) of Americans between the ages of 60-69 is $195,000. If a 35-year-old invested their $10,000 in savings and never saved another dime, they could have more than half the amount of money in retirement savings than the average American.\n\nWhen it comes down to deciding whether to use a Traditional agent or Felix Homes, think about the true cost of those commissions and ask yourself if your realtor is providing enough value to justify those commissions. If they aren’t perhaps it’s time to consider another option.\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n [Felix Homes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) is where five-star service meets low commissions!

You may be wondering, what does a buyer’s agent do, how much do they cost, and why should I use one?\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Does A Buyer's Agent Do?\n\n### Help you determine your budget\n\nA buyer’s agent’s first goal should be to help you determine your budget. If you are planning on using a mortgage to finance the purchase of your new home, your buyer’s agent should introduce you to a trusted lender who will pre-approve you for financing.\n\n### Narrow down your options\n\nOnce you have a budget in mind and are pre-approved for financing, the next step is to prioritize what you are looking for in a home. Are you interested in a particular number of bedrooms or bathrooms? Do you prefer a certain style of architecture? Are you open to older homes built in previous decades or do you only want to consider homes built in the past 5 years?\n\nAfter these questions are answered, your buyer’s agent should determine what you are looking for in your ideal neighborhood. Do you prefer an urban, suburban, or rural neighborhood? Are you looking for a neighborhood that is [family-friendly](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families) with a great [school district](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts) or are you interested in a neighborhood filled with [young professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals) and great nightlife?\n\nNow that your agent has an idea for your budget and preferences, they will search for available inventory using a system called the Multiple Listing Service or MLS. This system will allow your agent to see all of the available listings currently on the market and help them filter listings that meet your criteria. Your agent will then send you a list of between 10-20 listings that meet most of your preferences. When you review the list of homes, you should keep track of which ones you would like to tour and let your agent know so that they can set up a private showing on your behalf.\n\n### Schedule private showings\n\nYour agent will then accompany you to each private showing and as you are touring the property, a good agent will point out small details you should take note of such as the condition of the HVAC. A good agent will also help you make the right decision. For example, if you have a dog and one of your ‘must-haves’ is a fenced-in yard, don’t get discouraged if a particular home’s yard does not have a fence. Perhaps the home meets all of your other criteria and at the end of the day, adding a fence is a fairly straightforward and inexpensive upgrade you can make if you decide to purchase the home.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Make the best offer\n\nAt this point you’ve found a home that you love! How do you know what price you should offer the seller? What if there are other buyers interested in the property? This is where using a buyer’s agent becomes extremely important. Your agent should first determine what a fair price for the property is, independent of the current list price. They should use recent sales in the neighborhood and choose comparable homes with similar features and characteristics at which point they should determine the average price per square foot of those homes. Making a good offer goes beyond the offer price. Are you offering to pay cash or will there be a financing contingency? Do you include a contingency stating that you must sell your current home first? How are you going to split the closing costs?\n\n### Navigate the closing process\n\nAssuming your offer is accepted, your agent’s final task is to help you through the closing process. They should make sure that the inspection comes back clean and they will work alongside the title company to ensure everything goes off without a hitch.\n\n## How Much Does A Buyer’s Agent Cost?\n\nIn the United States unlike other countries, the buyer’s agent is compensated from the commission that the seller pays. Taking a step back, when you sell your home, traditionally your listing agent would have you sign a listing agreement where the total Realtor commission amounts to 6% of the sales price of the home. This 6% commission is split evenly with 3% going to the listing agent and 3% being offered to a buyer’s agent to incentivize them to bring their clients to the listing. This means that as a buyer, there is no out-of-pocket cost to using a buyer’s agent to help you through the process.\n\n## Why Should You Use A Buyer’s Agent?\n\nUsing a buyer’s agent is important because the stakes are so high. For most families, purchasing a home is their single largest investment and while hiring a Realtor who is a friend of the family can seem like a good idea, it’s important to make sure they are experienced. We suggest hiring an agent who has successfully completed at least 15 transactions in the past 12 months.\n\nWe also advocate interviewing multiple agents so that you can get an idea for what services they offer. For example, while nearly all agents will have access to the same inventory via the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), some firms, such as Felix Homes, offer a free moving service so that you don’t have to go through the hassle of hiring a moving company or, even worse, taking the DIY approach.","published_at":"2020-08-21T06:10:56.876Z","createdAt":"2020-08-21T06:10:15.232Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-26T21:25:23.800Z","__v":0,"image":{"_id":"5fc87554d709430017690bcc","name":"buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","alternativeText":"An image of a young couple and their daughter moving into their new home","caption":"","hash":"buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":90.04,"width":1200,"height":686,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":140,"size":8.83,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"large_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":572,"size":69.7,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/large_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"medium_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":429,"size":46.52,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_buyers-agent-comission-1200x686.jpg","hash":"small_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":286,"size":25.49,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/small_buyers_agent_comission_1200x686_9c91a67e19.jpg"}},"provider":"aws-s3","related":["5fc88147d709430017690bcd"],"createdAt":"2020-12-03T05:19:16.232Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-25T17:30:24.649Z","__v":0,"id":"5fc87554d709430017690bcc"},"postCategory":"601353b6d634cd92400d8630","locationGroup1":[],"locationGroup2":[],"locationGroup10":[],"locationGroup11":[],"locationGroup12":[],"locationGroup13":[],"locationGroup14":[],"locationGroup15":[],"locationGroup3":[],"locationGroup4":[],"locationGroup5":[],"locationGroup6":[],"locationGroup7":[],"locationGroup8":[],"locationGroup9":[],"name":"How does a buyer's agent get paid","faq":{"content":[{"question":"What is a buyer's agent and what do they do?","answer":"A buyer's agent is a real estate professional who helps homebuyers navigate the home buying process.

At Felix, we emphasize local expertise, financial savings, and an efficient, customer-focused selling experience.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Are Your Options When Selling Your Home?\n\nIn today’s market, home sellers have more options than ever for deciding how they’d like to list their homes. Some may choose to do the work themselves and list For Sale By Owner while others may decide to enlist the help of a real estate agent.\n\nIn our experience, most home sellers typically have two goals in mind; **keep as much of their home equity as possible and sell quickly**, as no one wants to buy a stale listing. As a seller, it’s important you know all the options when it comes to listing your home so you can achieve both of these goals.\n\n### Listing With A Low Commission Brokerage – Like Felix Homes\n\nA low-commission brokerage is a company that agrees to list your home for less than the age-old 3% commission that most agents typically charge. \n\nYou probably think about ways to save money or get a discount in other areas of your life – whether it’s using a discount code when shopping online or purchasing an item on sale at the grocery store. Why not when it comes time to sell your house?\n\nWhile not all discount brokers are created equal, we can speak for our company when we say that the level of service you receive is identical to that of a traditional 3% agent – just check out our 100+ five-star reviews online. \n\nUsing a low-commission Realtor with good reviews will certainly help keep more cash in your pocket at the closing table. For example, our clients save $12,375 in commission fees on average by choosing to list with Felix.\n\n### For Sale By Owner (FSBO)\n\nThe [For Sale By Owner](https://www.felixhomes.com/resources/sell-without-an-agent-nashville) route is certainly a possibility and a small percentage of homeowners decide to take on the role of being their own real estate agent. Typically, a seller would choose the FSBO route to save on real estate agent commission fees, however, they give up the experience and convenience that comes from working with a professional to guide them through the sales process. \n\nIf you have the time and know-how to deal with the sales process, are comfortable with real estate jargon, and have the courage to take on the legal aspects necessary to sell your home - this may be worth considering. Keep in mind that even if you decide to sell yourself, you are still expected to offer buyers agents a commission. \n\nAs with most things, it may pay to hire a top professional! The real estate business isn’t easy and any small mistake can cost you a lot of money and legal headache.\n\n### MLS-Only Listing\n\nAn MLS-only listing is essentially a variation of the For Sale By Owner method. The key difference is that the homeowner pays a real estate brokerage a flat fee upfront, to list their home on the MLS.\n\nListing your home on the MLS has many benefits – after all, this is the main platform that real estate agents use. Furthermore, when you list your home on the MLS, the property is syndicated to every real estate portal including Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com.\n\nThe downside of an MLS-only listing is that you are still doing the legwork yourself – from coordinating showings to negotiating the terms and navigating the closing process.\n\n### Listing With A 3% Commission Brokerage\n\nListing your house with a brokerage that will charge you a 3% commission is a common route many homeowners take. Similar to a low-commission brokerage, these firms offer a full-service experience where all of the details are handled for you by a professional.\n\nAs with a low-commission brokerage though, it’s important to ask who you are going to be working with so that you can research their online reviews and sales history. \n\nThis may seem obvious but the main difference between a traditional brokerage and a low-commission firm is the price you pay. Some may wonder why these Realtors still charge 3% and the main reason has to do with their overhead. Unlike low-commission brokerages, 3% commission firms are typically part of a franchise – think EXP Realty, Keller Williams, and ReMax. Having this additional overhead means they may be less willing to cut their fee.\n\n### Selling To An iBuyer – Sell Your Home For Cash\n\nAn “instant buyer” or iBuyer for short is by far the most convenient and quickest way to sell. Two of the most prominent iBuyers are OpenDoor and OfferPad. These companies will provide you with a cash offer on the spot.\n\nThe downside is the hefty fees associated with this convenient method. After all, these companies need to turn a profit so their goal is to purchase your home as cheaply as possible and resell it for as much as the market will allow. \n\nIn many cases, this results in significantly lower net proceeds that you’ll walk away with compared to listing your home on the market.\n\n### Selling Through An Auction\n\nSelling through an auction is a method some folks decide to take – especially if they have a unique home or large property. Before the auction day, there’s typically a “marketing period” when prospective buyers can tour your home and determine how much they would like to bid. \n\nAuctions can be a good idea when the value of the property is uncertain. This could result from a home that needs a full renovation or a piece of land that can be subdivided.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Felix Homes Is Nashville’s 1.5% Commission Realtor\n\nIf you’re considering listing your home with an agent and you live in Middle Tennessee, then Felix Homes may be for you! We entered the market in 2018 with the goal of being the most financially responsible way to sell a home. To us, that means achieving two goals – getting the highest price while paying the lowest fees. After all, parting with your home is not easy so the least we can do is make sure you walk away with as much money as possible to ease the pain.\n\nWe started the company because we felt that commission rates were getting out of hand. Let’s face it, a 6% commission may have been fair in the 1970s when homes were $100,000 and Realtors had to do a lot more work to sell a home. But today, a home in Nashville costs $800,000 on average, and leveraging the latest technology means that Realtors can use their time more efficiently.\n\n## Benefits Of Using Felix Homes To List Your House In Nashville\n\nOur client-focused approach has so many benefits – aside from the tens of thousands of dollars you can save in commission fees. \n\n### Nashville-Based And Independently Owned\n\nWe're locally owned and operated. In fact, if you find yourself in Downtown Nashville, feel free to drop by our office! We’re also not governed by a larger corporation or franchise which means we have more flexibility in the commission fees. \n\n### 100+ Five-Star Reviews From Happy Customers\n\nSince starting Felix Homes in 2018, there are two things we are most proud of:\n\n- We have saved our clients **$1,387,354** in commission fees to date!\n- We have over 100 five-star reviews\n\nWhen we started Felix in 2018, we believed homeowners’ top priority was to save on the commission fees but we quickly learned that this was only partially true. Selling a home is a big deal and homeowners want to list with someone they trust. A lot of Realtors like to throw around the phrase “You get what you pay for” but we knew this couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nToday, we have the reviews to provide it but don’t take our word for it – simply Google “Felix Homes Reviews” to see for yourself.\n\n### Efficient And Hassle-Free Selling Process\n\nWe only charge a 1.5% commission fee. This means we need to sell twice as many homes to make up for the discount we offer compared to a traditional 3% commission Realtor. This has forced us to put internal processes in place so that we can operate like a well-oiled machine. \n\nThe benefit to our clients is that we are much more experienced than your typical Realtor. Our experience allows us to cut through the noise to get offers more quickly, all while making fewer mistakes than a traditional Realtor would.\n\n### Fair And Financially Responsible Discounted Fee Structure\n\nIf you like money, you’ll like this – our clients save an average of $12,375 in commission fees per transaction. Since we charge just 1.5%, you’ll walk away with more of your hard-earned home equity. But, it gets better, if we happen to find the buyer and facilitate the entire transaction, we only charge a 3% total commission as opposed to the typical 6% – that’s half the cost you would typically spend on commission fees which means more money in your pocket!\n\n### Available Around The Clock Leading To Better Communication\n\nWe know just how stressful the home-selling process can be so our sole focus is making sure you have a five-star experience when working with Felix. \n\nIn our experience, a great customer-Realtor relationship depends on two things – communication and transparency. Working nights and weekends are the nature of the real estate industry and our team will be there around the clock to answer your questions.\n\n## Our Bullet Proof Process For Selling Your Home\n\nThe process of selling a home is filled with nuance. That’s why we truly believe using a professional, albeit one who charges a lower commission, is the right thing to do. Below is a step-by-step process for what it takes to sell a home.\n\n### Step 1: Start With A No-Obligation Home Valuation\n\nThe first step in deciding whether to sell your home is determining its current market value. At Felix Homes, we offer a complimentary home valuation appointment where we’ll come to your home and determine how much it will sell for given the market conditions. \n\nWe pride ourselves on taking a quantitative approach using a proprietary valuation model that we’ve developed in-house. During this meeting, we will also review all of the closing costs involved in selling a home so that you know exactly how much you’ll walk away with.\n\n### Step 2: Tips On Preparing Your Home For The Market\n\nIf you’re comfortable with the valuation we’ve provided, the next step is to prepare your home for the market. We’ll make recommendations on small renovation projects you can do to ensure your home sells for top dollar. If your home needs a bit more TLC, we have trusted professionals in the industry from painters to contractors that we can recommend.\n\n### Step 3: Professional Magazine-Quality Photos\n\nOnce your home is looking its best, we’ll schedule the listing photos. Our professional photographer has over 20 years of experience and has taken photos of thousands of homes. In addition to photos of your home’s interior and exterior, we’ll also take to the sky using the latest drone technology and capture the property from above. And before you ask – yes, this is all included in the 1.5% commission we charge.\n\n### Step 4: Create A Marketing Strategy And Receive Showings\n\nAfter the listing photos have been edited, it’s time to start the marketing engine. We like to craft a specific marketing strategy that’s unique for each home. That said, we cover our bases by:\n\n- Listing the property on the MLS.\n- Your listing will also be distributed to websites like Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, Trulia, and over 100 brokerage sites throughout Middle Tennessee.\n- We’ll personally email your listing to the top 2,000 Realtors in the greater Nashville area.\n- We offer an attractive yard sign that can be placed on your property.\n- We’re happy to host open houses!\n\n### Step 5: Get Offers And Negotiate The Best Terms\n\nHere comes the exciting part – receiving offers! Since your home will be priced accurately and marketed effectively, it’s only a matter of time before we get your first offer. In a perfect world, receiving multiple offers is the key to getting the best terms although depending on the current market conditions, this may be less likely.\n\nOnce we do get an offer we’ll explain the details to you in non-Realtor jargon and make recommendations on terms we should consider countering. And, we’ll update your net proceeds calculation so that you know exactly what you’ll walk away with.\n\n### Step 6: Accept An Offer And Kick-Off The Closing Process\n\nAccepting an offer is the easy part which will kick off the roughly 30-day closing process. Why does it take 30 days to close?\n\nFrom home inspections to the title search and underwriting the loan, this part of the process takes time. There’s a lot of moving pieces and a lot of people involved.\n\nBut don’t worry, we’ll work with the Buyer’s Agent, Lender, and Title \u0026 Escrow Processor to make sure the closing is smooth sailing. \n\n### Step 7: Close On Your Home And Enjoy The Savings\n\nFinally, it’s closing day – we can all breathe a sigh of relief and pop that bottle of bubbly! We’ll meet you at the closing table to make sure you dot your i’s and cross your t’s. After everyone signs, you’ll receive the proceeds you’ve been so anxiously awaiting and we’ll be paid for all of our hard work throughout the process. \n\nOh, and how could we almost forget – because you chose to sell your home with Felix, you’ll walk away with an extra $12,375 on average!\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions When Using A Low-Commission Realtor\n\n### Do Discount Realtors Under Price And Sell For A Lower Amount?\n\nAbsolutely not – the list price should be determined based on a quantitative analysis of recently sold comparable homes. Any Realtor, no matter the commission they charge should walk you through their process for valuing your home. \n\n### Do You Really “Get What You Pay For”?\n\nWhile we can’t speak for all low-commission brokerages out there, at Felix Homes, this is absolutely not the case. Just take a look at the 100+ five-star reviews we have on Google. \n\n## Our Final Thoughts On Using A Low Commission Brokerage\n\nChoosing the right path to sell your home is a significant decision that impacts not only your financial return but also your selling experience.

Learn how you can save thousands on real estate commissions without compromising on service.","body":"## Key Takeaways\n\n- Felix Homes was started in 2018 with the goal of being the most financially responsible way to buy or sell a home.\n- Felix Homes is Nashville's top low-commission brokerage having sold over 185 homes. \n- As of December 2024, Felix Homes has 120 five-star reviews on Google and has saved clients over $1,500,000 in commission fees.\n- Felix Homes may charge a lower commission but the service offered is second to none.\n\n## The Status Quo – 6% Commission Model\n\nAnyone who has bought or sold a home is likely familiar with the good ole 6% commission. This is the fee that most 'traditional' Realtors will charge to list a home. This 6% is commonly split between the listing agent (3%) who represents the seller and the buyer's agent (3%) who represents the buyer. \n\nLet's be honest, 6% of the sales price is A LOT – $42,000 for a $700,000 home! However, many Realtors claim that their fee is justified due to the high level of service they provide. And, to their credit, many Realtors do provide a great service. \n\nIn fact, the service real estate agents provide goes beyond helping you buy or sell a house – they act as counselors, trusted advisors, and connectors. They are the phone call you'll make at 11:00PM the day before closing and most likely, they'll pick up their phone at all hours of the day and night. \n\n## How Can You Save Money On Real Estate Commissions\n\nBelieve it or not, a few options are available if you're interested in saving money on Realtor commissions. \n\nSome people elect to sell their home themselves, also known as [for sale by owner](https://www.felixhomes.com/resources/sell-without-an-agent-nashville) (FSBO). But, for sale by owner transactions only account for 7% of home sales throughout the country. And, for good reason, most homeowners are not experts at selling real estate nor do they do so regularly. \n\nBuying or selling a home is such a large transaction that most are unwilling to risk making a mistake that could cost tens of thousands.  \n\nMore commonly, homeowners choose to work with a real estate agent to oversee the entire transaction. After all, with most things in life, it pays to hire a professional.\n\nAs I mentioned, working with a real estate agent can be expensive, as **many Realtors charge a 6% commission**. In Nashville, the median home price is $572,000, and the average real estate commission is 5.8%. This means the average home seller pays over **$33,000 in commission fees**. We agree it pays to work with a professional, but is it necessary to pay that much? \n\nIn my humble opinion, you shouldn’t pay 6% to sell your home. Instead, **I would recommend working with a full-service, low-commission real estate brokerage**.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is A Low Commission Real Estate Agent\n\nA low-commission real estate agent is an agent who charges a reduced fee to represent the seller when listing their home for sale. And yes, this is completely legal! By law, commissions must be negotiable – although many agents won't advertise that for obvious reasons. Before committing to a low-commission Realtor, it's important to learn about the two different types:\n\n### Full-Service, Low-Commission Brokerage\n\nAt Felix Homes, we fall under the category of a \"full-service low-commission\" brokerage. We like to say we are the most financially responsible way to buy or sell a home – but, we're not the cheapest option out there. This is a key distinction. I always tell our clients, that if they're *just* interested in saving money on commissions, they're in the wrong place. \n\nThe success behind Felix Homes is that we offer a 'white glove' service you'd expect when working with a traditional agent (i.e. we handle absolutely everything from start to finish). The only difference between Felix Homes and a traditional brokerage comes down to the commission we charge and the savings you'll receive on closing day. The commission we charge when listing a home is 1.5% compared to the 3% commission most traditional Realtors charge.\n\nBut, don't take our word for it – just Google \"Felix Homes Reviews\" to see what our past clients have said. Or, if you really want to put us to the test, call our office number listed at the top of this website and we guarantee we will pick up the phone! \n\nJokes aside, as your Realtor, we will be your trusted advisor throughout the entire process. There are also no hidden fees with our model, everything from the professional listing photos to marketing materials are included in the 1.5% price.\n\n### Flat-Fee MLS Company\n\nA flat fee MLS company is another type of low-commission model. As the name suggests, for a flat fee (*typically $300 – $1,000 that is paid in advance*) these companies will list your home on the MLS. However, it's important to keep in mind that **this is all you'll receive**. \n\nThis model is similar to for sale by owner (FSBO) in the sense that you are on your own. Most flat-fee companies do not offer any service beyond listing the home on the market. Key aspects of the process such as pricing the home, coordinating professional listing photos, creating the marketing material, coordinating showings, etc. are left up to you. \n\nIn exchange, these flat-fee MLS providers offer a chance to save more money if your home sells. Commonly, they will charge a fixed amount ($300 – $1,000) upfront to list your home in addition to a small percentage (0.5% – 1%) at closing if your home sells. Keep in mind that with the flat fee MLS option, you are still expected to offer a buyer's agent a competitive commission of between 2.5% - 3%.\n\n## Is A Low-Commission Agent The Same As A Discount Realtor\n\nYes, these terms are frequently used interchangeably. Technically, any licensed real estate agent that charges less than 6% could be considered a \"low-commission agent\" or \"discount agent\". That said, most commonly, these reduced commission models are broken down into two categories: \n\n- Full-Service, Low-Commission Brokerages\n- Flat-Fee MLS Companies\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Choosing The Option That's Right For You\n\nChoosing between a traditional agent, a full-service-low-commission agent, and a flat-fee MLS company may sound like an overwhelming decision. Ultimately, your decision should be based on who you will be working with on a day-to-day basis. \n\nFor example, I've worked with several traditional agents who should not be in the real estate business. I'm surprised to this day when I see an inexperienced, part-time agent listing a home – and to think that the homeowner is paying 3% for their service (or lack thereof) is even more shocking!\n\nI've also worked with some traditional agents who are great at their jobs. They work around the clock and have their clients' best interests at heart. \n\nOn the other hand, I've met some low-commission Realtors who are in over their heads and offer a terrible service. This is where the saying \"*you get what you pay for*\" comes from and I'll be the first to admit that with some companies, it's true. \n\nWhen it comes down to making a decision, my biggest recommendation is to interview a mix of agents – traditional AND low-commission to see which option works best for you.\n\n## How Much Do Low-Commission Real Estate Agents Charge As A Listing Fee?\n\nDiscount brokers charge different rates, but they are all less than the typical 3% listing commission rate a traditional agent charges. For example, Redfin charges 1.5%, whereas Homie and Trelora charge a flat dollar fee. At Felix Homes, we keep it simple with a low commission rate of just [1.5% for our services](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/one-and-a-half-percent-commission-realtor-nashville).\n\n## How Can Low Commission Real Estate Agents Afford To Charge Sellers Less?\n\nWhen I meet with prospective clients for the first time, I get the same question again and again, \"*How are you able to offer five-star service AND lower commission fees*\"? When you hear a pitch from a company that promises to charge half the cost and provide the same service, it may sound too good to be true. \n\nWhile I can't speak for other low-commission companies, here's how we are able to make the model work at Felix Homes:\n\n**1. We're an independently owned brokerage – not a franchise which allows us to keep all of the commissions we earn.**\n\n**2. By offering a lower commission, more people want to work with us which means we close more deals. By closing more deals, we can pass more savings along to our customers!**\n\nAfter I explain it, it starts to make sense. There truly are no smoke and mirrors here.\n\nYou see, real estate agents are required to hang their license at a real estate brokerage. This brokerage typically takes between 30% - 50% of the agent's gross commissions. After a deal closes, the 3% commission (or $16,000 for example) looks more like $8,000 – $10,000. After paying their brokerage, agents are still responsible for other costs such as software, insurance, and fees associated with keeping their license active. \n\nIn contrast, I started Felix Homes as an independent brokerage, and I am our broker. So, every commission I earn goes straight into my pocket as opposed to having to split it. Plus, by offering a great value to our clients, we benefit from word-of-mouth referrals which have become an integral part of our business.\n\n## What Are The Pros Of A Low-Commission Brokerage?\n\nCharging a lower commission not only allows me to set myself apart from the competition, it also makes me a better real estate broker. If there's one thing I've learned across the 185 homes I've sold, it's that no two real estate transactions are alike.\n\nExperience is gained through repeating an exercise time after time and I don't know of another agent who can say they've sold 185 homes in their career. \n\nPlus, the market is constantly changing. If you decide to hire an inexperienced, part-time agent who may sell one or two homes per year, what's the likelihood that they're familiar with the current state of the local market?\n\n## What Are The Cons Of A Low-Commission Brokerage?\n\nThe biggest downside of the low-commission model is getting over the stigma that some sellers may initially have. Like I said before, the saying \"you get what you pay for\" is generally pretty accurate with most things in life. \n\nWhen I first started Felix Homes back in 2018, I had a homeowner ask me, \"*how do I know you are really going to provide a great service?*\" When we first started out, we didn't have any reviews so he essentially had to take my word for it. Now, that question is a lot easier to answer. All I have to say is, \"*Google Felix Homes Reviews*\" and see what our past clients have said. \n\n## Are Low Commission Agents Licensed?\n\nAbsolutely! Just because I am a discount real estate agent doesn't mean I can skip the education and licensing process. I went through the same state licensing requirements as any other agent. When it comes to getting a real estate license in Tennessee, there are essentially two types:\n\n- Associate Broker License\n- Broker License\n\nAn associate broker is commonly referred to as an agent. They are required to take 120 hours of coursework, pass a state and national exam, and complete continuing education. Once they pass their exam, Associate Brokers are required to hang their license at a real estate brokerage, and all of their activities must be supervised by their Broker. \n\nReal estate agents who have practiced for at least 3 years are eligible to sit for the broker's exam. And, assuming the agent passes, they can officially become a broker and open up their own brokerage office. \n\nI am a licensed real estate broker, the highest designation. I started a low-commission brokerage by choice, to help save folks money. But, the education and licensing requirements are the same no matter what commission rate you decide to charge.\n\n## Do Low Commission Realtors Provide Less Service To Sellers?\n\nThis is a complicated answer, as every low-commission agency has its own set of practices and levels of service. Some low-commission companies, such as Homie – a Utah-based company – focus on a digital-agent experience. They will not meet with you in person, nor will they visit your home or host open houses. Their listing agent services are done electronically.\n\nOn the other hand, other low-commission Realtors, such as Felix Homes, provide you with a full list of agent services. This may include; listing your home, running multiple open houses, leveraging top-notch marketing, and providing prompt customer service.\n\n## Meet Felix Homes – The Full-Service, Low-Commission Brokerage\n\nOur company, Felix Homes, started in 2018. Our objective was to create the best, full-service real estate experience for our clients and simultaneously provide the most financially responsible way to sell a home. We're a local real estate company serving Nashville and greater Middle Tennessee.\n\nWe strive to get our sellers the highest price while charging them a lower commission. That said, just because our listing commission fees are lower than typical agents doesn't mean we offer a lower level of service. We are still a full-service real estate firm. Our discount real estate business is not the cheapest way to go, folks can certainly list their home as a for sale by owner transaction – but if you're looking for a professional, we'd be happy to help.\n\n## The Possibilities We Provide Each Home Seller\n\nWe're on a mission to help as many folks as possible live a more financially responsible life. The debt crisis is weighing heavily on many Americans, and we can all benefit from having a bit more money in our bank accounts each month.\n\nOn average, due to our reduced commission, Felix's clients save $12,375 when they buy or sell their homes. Imagine what you could do with an extra $12,375.\n\nSome of our sellers; paid off a large chunk of their student loans, took a family vacation, or got rid of a credit card debt that was costing them a few hundred dollars per month! If you're looking to sell your current home and buy a new home, think about how much money you can save over the lifetime of the loan if you put down an additional $12,375.\n\n## The Unspoken Reality\n\nWhen technology is done right, it makes life easier. The same is true for real estate. In our tech-savvy world, most buyers find their own homes. The days of driving up and down streets for hours to see which homes are available for sale are long gone. \n\nZillow, Realtor.com, and Felix Homes' [search tool](https://www.felixhomes.com/feed) can help you find your perfect home from the comfort of your living room couch. The job of a real estate agent, in today's modern world, is so much more efficient than it was many years ago. All of the technology tools from customer relationship management software to electronic signature platforms make the job of an agent more efficient.\n\nNot only has the job of an agent become more efficient thanks to technology, home prices have also increased significantly! A higher commission rate made sense when the median home price was $100,000. But those days are also long gone, especially in Middle Tennessee. The median home price in Nashville is $572,000. A 6% commission on $572,000 is a lot of money!\n\n## The Felix Homes Approach\n\nIn addition to saving you money, we believe in offering sellers an increased level of transparency. We're proud of our proven system and would love to give you a glimpse into our process. Here's how we get our sellers the highest price while charging them a lower commission:\n\n### Step 1 - The In-Person Home Valuation\n\nThe in-person home valuation is the first step in the process. We offer it as a complimentary service whether or not you decide to list with us. During the approximately 1-hour meeting, we'll start with a home tour where you have the opportunity to highlight any upgrades you've made. During the tour, I'll also make recommendations on how you can get your home ready for the market.\n\nAfter the tour, I'll take out my laptop where we will review comparable homes that have recently sold. I'll also walk you through all of the costs entailed when selling. By the end of the meeting, you will know: \n\n- What your home is worth in today's market\n- How long it will take to sell\n- How much you will net from the sale after all closing costs\n\n### Step 2 - Professional photos\n\nOur professional photographer will take approximately 40-50 high-definition photos of your home's interior and exterior. In addition, we'll include aerial photos taken with a drone at no additional cost. We also provide props for stagings, such as artwork, flowers, and accent pieces to really make these photos pop! Once we receive the photos, we will send them to a company that will professionally edit every photo. In under 48 hours, these magazine-quality photos will be ready to be shared with the world!\n\n### Step 3 - Your home is now on the market\n\nRoughly 48 hours after the photo shoot, the actual home-selling process can begin by getting it listed on the MLS. Once the listing has been added to the MLS, it will syndicate with over 100+ real estate websites, allowing buyers to easily find your home. \n\nWe'll take to social media and run various Facebook and Instagram ads. We're no stranger to hosting an open house either, providing you with a professional yard sign, or listing your home in our weekly email newsletter. Each home gets a custom marketing approach because each home is unique. We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. After all, our job is to make sure you get the best offer. The only way to do that is to make sure the right buyer can find the home through a custom marketing approach.\n\n### Step 4 - The offers will begin flowing in\n\nNot long after your house is listed on the MLS, we will start to receive showing requests. You have absolute control over accepting the requests that come in to ensure the showings don't disrupt your day. \n\nAfter a few showings, hopefully, we will receive an offer! At Felix, we're not just your listing agent with the sole goal of selling a home, we're also educators. Each buyer will have a different offer with varying contingencies. Together, we'll review each offer and help you understand the pros and cons. There are many variables to take into consideration. For instance, will there be a financing contingency, appraisal contingency, or inspection contingency? As a seller, deciding which offer to take is difficult to navigate alone, but with our experience, we'll help you make the best decision.\n\n### Step 5 - Accepting an offer\n\nOnce you accept an offer, the closing process begins. During this time, the buyer will likely conduct a home inspection and submit a list of repairs they would like you to make. Our job is to negotiate which repairs, if any, will be made. Or, in lieu of repairs, some sellers decide to offer a credit. After the inspection period, the buyer will also hire an appraiser. The closing process, which typically is about 30 days can be stressful as you wonder if the sale will go through. With Felix, you'll have nothing to worry about as I'll be by your side the entire time. \n\n### Step 6 - Closing day\n\nCongratulations – You've made it to closing day! We'll review your closing statement together and I'll answer any questions you may have. It's at this point when our clients really appreciate the difference between Felix Homes and a traditional agent. They see how much money they saved in commission fees and look at the final amount that is about the be deposited in their bank account. \n\nOnce all parties have signed, you've officially sold your house! The new owner will move in and create many lasting memories and you'll get to celebrate!\n\nThat's it, that's our process. It's straightforward, comprehensive, and complete. \n\n## Why Do 6% Agents Love To Hate On Discount Real Estate Agents?\n\nWhy would a traditional Realtor throw shade at a model that saves sellers thousands in commission fees? Perhaps it's because they feel threatened by the way our industry is changing. Discount real estate brokers are disrupting the real estate industry by reducing agent commission fees. Most folks are scared of change, but at Felix, we embrace it! \n\nWe realized the 6% fee was too much, and we're not going to tolerate it anymore. After all, you work day after day to pay your mortgage in an attempt to build home equity as an investment for your future. When it comes time to sell, why should such a large portion of this hard-earned equity go to your Realtor?\n\n## Our Final Thoughts\n\nIn conclusion, choosing a low-commission brokerage like Felix Homes can be a financially savvy decision without sacrificing quality service. By providing comprehensive support throughout the buying or selling process, we demonstrate that you can achieve exceptional results while saving significantly on commission fees. \n\nWhether you opt for a full-service low-commission brokerage or explore other alternatives, it's essential to prioritize the level of service and expertise you receive. At Felix Homes, we’re committed to helping you maximize your investment while keeping your hard-earned money in your pocket. Embrace the change in the real estate landscape, and experience firsthand the benefits of working with a brokerage that puts your financial well-being first. Discount brokers are here to stay.\n\nIf you're interested in taking the first step and receiving a complimentary home valuation, please contact us today at [contact@felixhomes.com](mailto:contact@felixhomes.com) or [615-354-5731](tel:6153545731).","published_at":"2020-11-14T20:58:30.149Z","createdAt":"2020-11-14T20:57:22.421Z","updatedAt":"2024-12-17T23:24:07.929Z","__v":0,"image":{"_id":"66f307e6b1327e0016c4f0cd","name":"Group 923.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","hash":"Group_923_e35b3d4970","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":44838.53,"width":5760,"height":3772,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Group_923_e35b3d4970.png","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Group 923.png","hash":"thumbnail_Group_923_e35b3d4970","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":238,"height":156,"size":106.42,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_Group_923_e35b3d4970.png"},"large":{"name":"large_Group 923.png","hash":"large_Group_923_e35b3d4970","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":1000,"height":655,"size":1769.64,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/large_Group_923_e35b3d4970.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Group 923.png","hash":"medium_Group_923_e35b3d4970","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":491,"size":1004.77,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/medium_Group_923_e35b3d4970.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Group 923.png","hash":"small_Group_923_e35b3d4970","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":327,"size":450.49,"path":null,"url":"https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/small_Group_923_e35b3d4970.png"}},"provider":"aws-s3","related":["5fcaa2b295b44100172b83db"],"createdAt":"2024-09-24T18:41:42.737Z","updatedAt":"2024-09-24T20:04:45.719Z","__v":0,"id":"66f307e6b1327e0016c4f0cd"},"postCategory":"60135365d634cd92400d862e","locationGroup1":[],"locationGroup2":[],"locationGroup10":[],"locationGroup11":[],"locationGroup12":[],"locationGroup13":[],"locationGroup14":[],"locationGroup15":[],"locationGroup3":[],"locationGroup4":[],"locationGroup5":[],"locationGroup6":[],"locationGroup7":[],"locationGroup8":[],"locationGroup9":[],"name":"Low commission real estate agents","h1":"Nashville's Top Low Commission Real Estate Agents (Don't Pay 6%)","faq":{"content":[{"question":"What are some of the decisions that need to be made when selling a home?","answer":"When selling a home, many decisions need to be made, including what town/state you're moving to, how much you'd like to sell the home for, and the timeline of selling your home.

By working with a top real estate agent, you alleviate the pressure and can leverage the knowledge of a local expert. You also gain a competitive advantage over other buyers to find the home of your dreams. An agent serves as your guide for navigating different [neighborhoods](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-neighborhoods-in-nashville) and determining your best fit. They can even give you a leg up on the competitors by providing you with “coming soon” or “off-market” properties.  \n\nThe best real estate agents keep the home buying process seamless and fun. They provide guidance on making competitive offers and handle the negotiation process. You can even count on your agent to aid in finalizing the contract terms and throughout the remainder of the closing process. \n\nWhether you’re a first-time buyer or an experienced homeowner, here are some things you can expect when working with a leading buyer’s agent.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is The Job Of A Buyer’s Agent?\n\nIn order to select an exceptional buyer’s agent, it’s important to understand their duties and responsibilities. Their primary role is to guide you through the many phases of buying a home and aid in finalizing the transaction.    \n\nAs you get started, a buyer’s agent will learn about your wants, needs, and budget. They will provide insight into the [current market trends](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-real-estate-market-update), along with how it aligns with your price range.  Oftentimes, a buyer’s agent specializes within a target area that can further help to refine your search. \n\nOnce you’ve found a property that checks all the boxes, a buyer’s agent will advise on tips for making a competitive offer. They will also handle the negotiation of the offer and the terms and contingencies that are included. Following an accepted offer, the buyer’s agent will aid in the closing process to ensure a successful, hassle-free purchase.\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the latest homes for sale in Nashville](https://www.felixhomes.com/homes-for-sale/city/tn/nashville)**\n\n## Why Is It Important To Choose A Buyer’s Agent Who's Experienced?\n\nAn agent’s experience can ultimately be the deciding factor on whether or not you get the home of your dreams. When selecting a buyer’s agent to work with, you’ll want to be sure to verify their experience and background.\n\nIn most industries, one’s experience level implies a long tenure within the business. However, in real estate, an agent’s expertise is not always determined by the number of years in practice. A true representation of their level of skill derives from the volume of completed real estate transactions, not by the number of years worked. \n\nMost agents close roughly 3-5 transactions per year. However, at Felix Homes, our agents complete between 3-5 transactions each month! Due to the significant increase in deals, our agents gain more exposure and experience to unique situations. Also, they can quickly spot costly mistakes that other agents could easily fail to see. \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Why It's Important To Choose The Right Real Estate Buyer's Agent\n\n### Give you insight into the neighborhood\n\nAn agent with experience will know the ins and outs of different neighborhoods. Purchasing a home is an investment, and you’ll want to be sure the surrounding neighborhood doesn’t have a negative trajectory. A buyer’s agent can provide insight into community associations, [top-performing schools](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/nashville-suburbs-with-best-school-districts), and the [level of crime](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/safest-neighborhoods-in-nashville) within a designated area. They can also point you in the right direction for a location suitable for [young professionals](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/where-to-live-in-nashville-for-singles-and-young-professionals), [families](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families), or [senior living](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-retire-in-tennessee).\n\n**[PRO TIP: See the best places to live in Nashville for families](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-places-to-live-in-nashville-for-families)**\n\n### Help you find ‘coming soon’ or ‘off-market’ properties\n\nOnline listing platforms, such as the multiple listing service (MLS), showcase the majority of the available inventory. However, a great buyer’s agent is also on the hunt for “coming soon” or “off-market” properties. These homes have yet to hit the market and provide the client with a leg up on a potential listing. An experienced agent will often leverage various networking channels, such as Facebook groups, to gain access to future listings.\n\n### Help you make the most competitive offer on a home\n\nMaking an offer on a home you love is exciting but also brings on a lot of nerves. Especially if the market is competitive or favors the sellers, the right offer can have a huge impact. Making a strong and favorable initial offer could dictate if you succeed or miss out on the home of your dreams. A great agent guides you throughout the process and helps you stand out from the rest. Additionally, an experienced buyer’s agent knows the tips for winning in a competitive bidding war. They can guide you through which contingencies to include and how you can make your offer more appealing by including items such as a pre-approval letter from a trusted lender, and even a personal letter to the sellers.\n\n### Help you negotiate the best offer and terms\n\nA great buyer’s agent doesn’t have a mediocre approach to negotiation. Instead, they strive to finalize the deal with the best terms for their client. An agent with experience provides insight on a recommended offer price taking into account the current market demands. Agents will typically summarize this information in a [comparative market analysis (CMA) report](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/comparative-market-analysis). If the list price is too high, the agent negotiates on the client’s behalf to achieve a fair price.  Additionally, the agent will negotiate the terms of the contract, along with important contingencies to protect the buyer. This can include a home warranty, negotiating the closing costs, or allowing the buyer early occupancy of the property. \n\n### Make sure you are legally protected\n\nBeyond the house-hunting and negotiation portion, a buyer’s agent also ensures you are legally protected in the purchase. This is crucial because, believe it or not, when buying a home a lot can go wrong. If concerns arise from the home inspection, a good agent knows how to get your earnest money back. Additionally, in the event of unforeseen financial mishaps, an experienced buyer’s agent steps in to assist with further negotiation or to void the contract.\n\n## How Has The Job Of A Real Estate Buyer’s Agent Gotten More Efficient\n\n### 99% of real estate inventory is online\n\nIn today’s world, almost everything operates in some capacity online, and that goes the same for real estate. Whereas previously agents carried around physical binders of active listings, now with the online MLS, all of the inventory is available in real-time. Potential homebuyers can filter through the listings right from the comfort of their own homes. This allows the buyer to browse and select their own listings, and leverage the agent to set the private tour.\n\n**[PRO TIP: Set up your custom feed so that you never miss a new listing](https://www.felixhomes.com/feed)**\n\n### Electronic signature platforms\n\nWith the help of electronic signature platforms, real estate deals can advance in a fraction of the time. Now, an agent can forgo needing to travel and meet a client in person to obtain a signature on a contract or document. This is a tremendous benefit for expediting processes more efficiently in the real estate industry. Additionally, e-signature platforms minimize potential risks by securely transferring documents or contracts.\n\n## Since A Buyer’s Agent's Job Has Gotten More Efficient, Why Do They Still Make Such A Large Commission\n\nA buyer’s agent receives a commission payout from the [seller’s closing costs](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/a-definitive-guide-to-closing-costs). Traditionally, that percentage falls somewhere between 2.5% and 3% of the final sale price. Although the commission is technically [paid by the seller](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/how-does-a-buyers-agent-get-paid), an agent factors in the commission payout when determining the listing price.\n\nWith the technology at our fingertips, more times than not, the homebuyer is the one actually finding the home. Don’t get us wrong, a buyer’s agent still plays an important role in other key aspects, such as negotiation and legality. However, since the traditional role of a buyer’s agent has since evolved, shouldn’t the fees follow? \n\nThis has led to a common practice known as a [buyer’s agent commission rebate](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee).\n\n## What's A Buyer’s Agent Commission Rebate?\n\nIn simple terms, a buyer’s agent commission rebate is like the 'cash back' you get from using a credit card. There’s a bit more to the concept, but it occurs when a buyer’s agent gives a portion of their commission to the buyer. The amount can be a percentage or a defined dollar amount. The notion of a commission rebate has become increasingly popular in several states. However, the state of Tennessee has made this practice illegal. \n\nTennessee is one of only 10 states that considers a buyer’s rebate illegal. Not to worry, at Felix Homes, not only are we fighting against the outlaw, but we are the [only brokerage that has found a legal workaround](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee). Under federal law, real estate commissions must be negotiable. Therefore, whenever we make an offer for one of our buyer’s we reduce our commission that the seller pays to only 2%. Then, included within the contract is a stipulation that the seller must contribute 1% of the final sales price towards the buyer's closing costs.\n\nThis concept is one of the many unique factors that make Felix Homes Nashville's most financially responsible way to buy or sell a home.","author":"Felix Homes","slug":"how-to-choose-a-top-real-estate-buyers-agent","title":"How To Choose A Top Real Estate Agent (Buyer's Agent) In Nashville","isFeatured":false,"description":"Thinking of buying a home?

In reality, a Realtor can be an invaluable asset and keep you on track from start to finish. But who pays who? How does a Realtor get paid on a new construction home if there's not a traditional seller on the other side?\n\nDon't worry; we did all the research to make the journey as transparent and easy as possible. Here's what to know and how to get started.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Realtors are paid by the seller (the home builder) on the closing day.\n- You’ll get help on everything from [understanding the new construction process](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/first-time-home-buyer-new-construction) to negotiating the price with a knowledgeable Realtor by your side.\n- It’s not in your best interest to rely on the builder for information or use the builder’s sales agent as your own.\n- Realtors only get paid if the sale closes successfully. If you do not close on the home, you do not have to pay your Realtor.\n- By using Felix as your buyer's agent, you can save up to 1% off the sales price thanks to our [Buyer's Savings Program](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/buyers-agent-commission-rebate-tennessee).\n\n\n## What’s The Difference: Broker vs Agent vs Realtor\n\n- Broker: Licensed brokers can run their own real estate brokerage and hire agents.\n- Agent: Real estate agents are also licensed professionals but must work under a licensed broker.\n- Realtor: Realtors belong to a trade group called the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\n## Who Is Involved In The New Construction Sales Process?\n\nThere are several parties involved in the sale of a new construction home, so let’s take a look at what to expect from the buyer’s and seller’s side.\n\n### The Buyer’s Side\n\n- Buyer: The buyer is a person (or several people) buying a new construction home or an existing property. \n- Buyer’s Agent: Buyer's agents are real estate agents, Realtors, or brokers who are legally and ethically required to look out for your best interest when helping you buy a property.\n- Buyer’s Closing Company: A closing company is usually referred to as a title company and handles your escrow and closing matters.\n- Buyer’s Lender: The buyer's lender is the financial institution, like a bank or credit union, that gives you a mortgage for a house or new build.\n\n\n### The Seller’s Side\n\n- Seller / Builder: When you buy a new construction home, the builder is also typically the seller.\n- Builder’s Sales Agent: A builder's agent represents the builder during the entire sales process. You could also use the term “seller’s agent” instead.\n- Builder’s Closing Company: Just like on the buyer’s side, the closing company is a title company and attorneys that help close the sale. \n\n\n## Who Pays The Buyer’s Agent Commission When Buying New Construction?\n\n![Real estate agent talking on cell phone.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_2_d15c9c4a7e_2f9d2a235b.png)\n\nIf you’re nervous about paying a Realtor’s commission out of pocket when buying new construction, don’t worry. The [buyer’s agent commission](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/how-does-a-buyers-agent-get-paid) comes from the seller, which is typically the home builder in the case of a new construction home purchase. It also works the same way whether you choose to buy a new construction home or an existing home. But if you don’t end up buying the home, you won’t owe a dime. The agent fees are only paid if the transaction closes. When you use Felix as your buyer's agent, we reduce the commission we get from the builder so that you can save on the sales price.\n\n## Benefits Of Using A Buyer’s Agent In A New Construction Transaction\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to [use a buyer’s agent during a new construction transaction](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/do-you-need-a-realtor-for-new-construction). Here’s how they help make it as seamless as possible.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Help you get pre-approved with a lender\n\nHome builders usually work with a preferred lender. That said, you can use whoever you want, but the preferred lender may pass on perks to the buyer, like a credit towards your closing costs. Agents are also familiar with local lenders in their area and which lender may serve you the best. For example, some lenders specialize in working with first-time home buyers, veterans, investment buyers, or self-employed professionals. Your agent can also help determine how much of a down payment you will need for the loan type you decide to choose.\n\n### Help determine what you’re looking for in a home\n\n![Real estate agent showing his clients around a home](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_3_0683e17659_a9cb705847.png)\n\nSome new construction homes look like carbon copies of each other, and others offer a dozen unique floor plans to choose from. Sometimes you can even customize features like cabinet colors, flooring, and kitchen upgrades. Buyer’s agents can help narrow down all your options to find your dream home. They’ll help you come up with a wish list and know which builders can deliver on your vision.\n\n### Help you find the perfect location\n\nYou’re wise to team up with a buyer's agent who is a local expert. Whether you’re thinking about schools or a home with a view, they intimately know the area and which locations are perfect for your lifestyle.\n\n### Vet local builders\n\nIf you’re house hunting in an area that’s booming with development, you'll find several builders to choose from. Unfortunately, not all builders celebrate high-quality craftsmanship and customer service. A local real estate agent will know [which builders are worth working with](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/best-custom-home-builders-tennessee) and will give you insight into their reputation.\n\n### Negotiate the terms of the purchase on your behalf\n\nNew construction homes come with a base price, but that doesn’t mean there’s no room to [negotiate with the builder](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/negotiate-with-the-builder-when-buying-a-new-construction-house). Realtors help with the terms of your sale to get you the best terms possible. Even if you can’t get the sales price any lower, your agent can help negotiate lower closing costs, a better home warranty, or upgrade discounts.\n\n### Educate you on the build process\n\nWhether you’re a first-time home buyer or a seasoned pro, you need someone to keep you up to date on the building process. Builders and their sales teams aren’t always known for their robust communication. They’re busy serving multiple customers and building homes, leaving you waiting for more info. Realtors know what delays are normal, like weather and supply chain issues, and which need a follow-up with the builder. Your agent stays in touch with the builder, educates you on the process, and intervenes if there’s a problem or if deadlines are getting missed.\n\n### Work with your lender on your loan application\n\nLoan applications feel like they take forever to complete, and the process is not over once you submit your initial application. You’ll need to provide proof of income, tax returns, and other required documentation. Buyer’s agents know the process inside and out and stay in touch with your lender on what’s needed and when. You’ll stay organized and on track without worrying about making a mistake.\n\n### Monitor the construction progress\n\n![Image of a home builder working on the framing of a new home](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_4_5fad01811d_ce5992b12b.png)\n\nEven if you already live in the area you’re buying a new construction home in, there's no way to hang around and check the progress all the time. Life gets busy and you’ll quickly learn there are dead periods where it seems like little progress is being made. Builders must secure permits, schedule their crew, and figure out their materials before anything happens on your lot.\n\nBuyers’ agents stay on top of the construction process and keep you sane. They let you know what to expect and make you aware of any delays which could impact your closing date estimate. Their input is especially important if you’re waiting to list your current home or if you need to negotiate a short-term rental.\n\n### Help sell your current home if you have one\n\nIt can be beneficial to use the same agent to buy your new construction home and list your current one. They’ll have more insight into the sales price you need to secure and when to list it to coincide with the completion of your new build. Agents also have experience dealing with unexpected issues. For example, if the new construction is facing delays, your agent can help you explore renting back the current home you're selling for a brief period. Felix can not only help you save when you purchase a new home. We're committed to lower commission fees and [only charge 1.5% to list with us](https://www.felixhomes.com/sell). Past sellers have saved $12,375 in commission fees on average which can go a long way if you decide to make upgrades to your new build!\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Schedule your inspections\n\nYou'll need a [home inspection](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/new-construction-inspection) to make sure your new build is ready to go. But unlike a traditional home sale, you probably need a few different types of home inspections for a new build. You may decide to have a pre-pour inspection before the foundation is set. It's also normal to have a pre-drywall inspection and a blue-tape inspection to sign off on the completed work.\n\n### Help you avoid making a mistake\n\nThere are endless details to consider when buying a new construction home, and it's easy to make a mistake. Agents understand the process and what to look for before you lock in the deal. They may know to ask about issues on your lot, like where utilities will lie before the build starts or negotiate an included termite bond.\n\nBuyer’s agents are also experts at thinking through all of the details. From backsplashes to countertops, they’ll know what trends hold their value and how to plan.\n\n## Can I Use The Builder’s Sales Agent As My Realtor?\n\nSome buyers think it’s easier to just use the builder’s sales agent to represent them during the sale, but it’s just not a good idea. The listing agent represents the builder’s interests. They’re unlikely to advocate on your behalf if an issue pops up. They also won’t help you negotiate a better purchase price. At the end of the day, the builder is their client.\n\n### What Is Dual Agency?\n\nSome brokerages represent both the home seller and the buyer in a real estate transaction. This is referred to as a dual agency and it’s not usually a good idea. In the context of new construction, if you decide to use the builder’s sales agent, they have an inherent conflict of interest working with you as the buyer. They can’t remain impartial and best serve you if you’re unhappy with the negotiations or construction process. \n\n## Will The Builder Give Me A Better Price If I Don’t Have An Agent?\n\nSure, it would be nice to save some extra money, but forgoing a Realtor isn’t the way to do it. Builders won’t pass on the savings or give you a better price if you decide to work directly with their sales team during the home buying process. If anything, you’re more likely to get a better deal on the home and potential upgrades when working with a Realtor.\n\nOne way to save some extra money when purchasing a new or existing home is by having a Felix represent you as your buyer's agent. At Felix, we reduce our commission so that you can save on the sales price.\n\n## What’s A Procuring Cause?\n\nHave you seen the term “procuring cause” somewhere in a new home contract? These indicate a real estate agent’s actions that successfully result in a sale. Why does it matter? It all comes down to who earns the commission for the property. \n\nSometimes the procuring cause comes into question if one Realtor introduced you to the property, another met you at an open house, and yet another offered to help you write an offer on the property. Things can get messy quickly and potentially hold up your sales transaction. You can avoid problems by always being upfront. Tell your real estate agent if you're already working with another professional.\n\n## Should I Sign A Buyer Representation Agreement?\n\n![Image of a person signing a document.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_does_a_realtor_get_paid_on_new_construction_5_14841f82d0_873dd0ff2e.png)\n\nIt can be good to sign a buyer's representation agreement, depending on how it’s structured. The agreement helps clarify the process, the Realtor’s responsibilities to you, and defines all of the expectations on both sides. Agents want to make sure you won’t suddenly decide to work with someone else after investing time into helping you as a client.\n\nThere are tons of benefits for the Realtor in these agreements, but buyers get some peace of mind too. For starters, the agent is now responsible for the work that they promise to provide. It also means you are their top priority. \n\nDespite some of the perks, you don't have to sign a buyer representation agreement if you’re uncomfortable with it. If you want more flexibility, you can also ask for an agreement with an expiration date or one that only covers a specific property or geographic location.\n\n## How Much Is The Buyer’s Agent Commission?\n\nThe total real estate commission the seller typically pays is 6% of the home's sale price. The buyer's agent usually receives half the total commission or 3%. These figures hold true whether you’re buying new construction or a resale property.\n\nA buyer’s agent commission might vary by location or builder, but remember, you won’t need to worry about the cost. The seller is responsible for the commission.\n\n## When Does The Buyer’s Agent Get Paid With New Construction?\n\nA buyer’s agent gets paid a commission on closing day. At this point, the construction would have been completed allowing you to close on the property. This ends up being beneficial for buyers and sellers alike since the seller only pays a commission for a successful outcome. After all, the Realtor is going to stay invested in the process and work on your behalf until you have the keys to your new home.\n\n## Is A Buyer’s Agent Allowed To Offer A Commission Rebate?\n\nA commission rebate is money that your agent refunds you at closing. It's a way to sweeten the deal and secure your business, but there are limitations. A buyer's agent can only agree to offer a rebate if state law allows it. Currently, 40 out of 50 states allow commission rebates. There are 10 states where offering a commission rebate is actually illegal.

Referrals can be helpful, but every purchase is unique, especially when it comes to new construction builds or the purchase of model homes. Yet going online for reviews can also pose issues. Builders generally don't upload all of their available inventory to sites like Zillow and the MLS. Withholding their available listings makes their inventory seem lower and more in demand than it really is. \n\nNow that you know everything about how Realtors get paid on a new construction home, you’re ready to start house hunting.

This rebate provides significant savings to home buyers, challenging the traditional 6% commission structure. We leverage technology to offer lower commission fees, and make the case that the traditional 3% buyer’s agent commission is outdated. While we acknowledge the value of professional guidance in the home buying process, we encourage homebuyers to negotiate commission rates and take advantage of rebates to save on the largest investment most people will make.\n\n## Does Felix Homes Offer A Buyer Rebate In Georgia?\n\nIn short, yes, Felix Homes is proud to offer a home buyer rebate in Georgia! The exact amount of the rebate is dependent on the commission the seller is offering a buyer’s agent. \n\nFor example, let’s say that the seller is offering a 3% commission to the buyer’s agent. In this scenario, we would provide our client with a rebate equal to 1% of the purchase price. On the other hand, if the seller is offering a 2.5% commission to the buyer’s agent, then the buyer rebate would be 0.5% of the purchase price. \n\nThis buyer rebate – or as we call it, our Buyer Savings Program, is eligible to clients who have toured 14 homes or less with us. Once we have shown the client 15 homes, they are no longer eligible for a commission rebate.\n\n## What Is A Buyer Agent Commission?\n\nA buyer’s agent commission is the amount of compensation an agent receives for representing the buyer in a transaction. This amount has historically been 3% of the sales price. In most cases, the buyer’s agent is only entitled to a commission if the transaction closes. \n\nIn Georgia, the buyer agent commission is typically 2.5% - 3% of the sales price. Considering how the internet has allowed homebuyers to do much of the home searching themselves, the 3% commission seems drastically inflated, right?\n\n## Who Pays The Buyer Agent Commission?\n\nAny rational person would suggest that the seller would pay for the listing agent commission, and the buyer pays the buyer agent commission. This is a big misconception. Historically, the home seller is responsible for paying the agent commission for both the buyer and seller!\n\nOn average, this is a total of 6% of the purchase price in commission fees the seller ends up paying. The buyer's agent gets a 3% fee, and the listing agent would get a 3% fee. On a $700,000 home, that is $42,000 in realtor commission fees. That's a lot of money by any standards.\n\nJust because the buyer does not have to pay out of pocket to use the services of a buyer's agent doesn't mean it is free. A simple economics course would teach you that the buyer's agent commission is factored into the sales price. This is why so many buyers attempt to bypass the services of an agent to get a better price. Luckily, with a home buyer rebate, buyers can have their cake and eat it too by both saving money thanks to the commission rebate and also benefitting from the experience of a licensed agent.\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## What Is A Home Buyer Rebate?\n\nA home buyer rebate is when a buyer's agent gives their client back a portion of their commission they receive from the seller. Think of a commission rebate like cash back on a credit card. For instance, if a buyer's agent collected a 3% commission, or $21,000, they may elect to keep $14,000 of that commission and give their client a commission rebate of $7,000. \n\nA Realtor may decide to do this as a token of appreciation, a simple thank you, or as a way to get more clients! Commission rebates allow agents to compete for a buyer's business, not just on the level of service they provide but also the price they charge for that service. It's a win-win!\n\nThe concept of a buyer's commission rebate has become increasingly popular in recent years as buyers understand that they take on more of the legwork in the home search process. Buyers also understand that as home prices continue to appreciate, a 3% commission on a $100,000 home in 1980 is a lot less than a 3% commission on a $700,000 home today.\n\n## What Value Does A Buyer Agent Offer?\n\nAs unconventional as this may sound, the reality is, when it comes to being a real estate agent, a buyer's agent's job has drastically changed since the adoption of the internet.\n\n### What Did A Buyer's Agent Do Before The Internet?\n\nRewind the clock 15 or 20 years, and yes, these agents had their hands full discovering new inventory and manually coordinating when to physically tour homes. They would literally carry around a big binder filled with properties listed for sale. Nothing was online so if a home buyer wanted to see what inventory was available, they would first call their Realtor who would manually look through their binder and pick a few properties that met the buyer's needs.\n\nIf the buyer was then interested in making an offer on the property, doing a [comparable market analysis](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/comparative-market-analysis) wasn't as easy as it is today. Their agent would have to seek out all of the recent comps in their binder to manually compute their opinion of the [home's value](https://www.felixhomes.com/how-much-is-my-house-worth). These old-school agents didn't even have electronic signature software so every time a document needed to be signed by their client, they had to hop in their car and drive over to their client. All this time-consuming work meant that buyer agent commission rebates were never brought up until the advent of technology caused a huge shift in the industry.\n\n### How Did Technology Make The Job Of A Buyer Agent More Efficient?\n\nIn today's technological age, so much of these manual buyer agent tasks can be accomplished with the click of a mouse, or simply by scrolling on your phone. The internet and apps allow the home buyer to do most of the legwork! Buyers are able to preselect their 'requirements', and the [home-search website](https://www.felixhomes.com/feed) will automatically show them homes in their desired area that meet these requirements.\n\nIf you want 4 bedrooms, there's a filter for that. If you need a two-car garage, there is a filter for that too. All you need to do is ask your Realtor to unlock the front door so you can see if the pictures live up to the hype! If you're interested in making an offer on a home, your agent can easily do a comparable market analysis to determine what a fair price for the home should be. There is no longer the need to manually compute these critical numbers! **No wonder buyers are increasingly asking their agent for a rebate.**\n\n## Should You Use A Buyer Agent Or Represent Yourself?\n\nUsing a buyer’s agent is a valuable asset and we encourage you to work with one. After all, purchasing a home may be the largest investment you make. \n\nIt's a good idea to have a professional in your corner to help answer any of the questions you may have and help you negotiate the purchase. \n\nBut the reality is, in today's technology-driven world, buyer's agents are just not worth 3% of the final sales price. This is why many folks are starting to ask for a home buyer rebate from real estate agents.\n\n## Is It Legal For Real Estate Agents To Give Part Of Their Commission To Buyers In Georgia?\n\nIn the vast majority of the country, currently 40 of the 50 states, rebates are legal meaning agents are able to give any amount of their commission back to their clients. And yes, buyer rebates are perfectly legal in Georgia!\n\nThis unique business model can save home buyers thousands. Many buyers ask for a commission rebate as they realize there isn't a great deal of work that goes into representing them in this modern era. They also understand that the job of a buyer's agent has gotten more efficient through technology and the internet.\n\n## **What States Do Not Allow A Buyer Agent Rebate?**\n\nAs crazy as this sounds, there are still 10 states where it is illegal for an agent to give their client a commission rebate. \n\n- Alaska\n- Alabama\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Louisiana\n- Missouri\n- Mississippi\n- Oklahoma\n- Oregon\n- Tennessee\n\n![Infographic showing the states where a buyer agent commission rebate is legal.](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Buyer_Commission_Reabte_Infographic_3b96ebfe26.svg)\n\nAlthough it's not legal for an agent to give part of their commission to the buyer in these 10 states, the commission rate can still be negotiated. There is no law mandating that the buyer's agent must take 3% of the purchase price as their commission. \n\n## How Can Felix Homes Help?\n\nFelix Homes is a [low-commission real estate brokerage](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/low-commission-real-estate-agents-nashville). We work with both [buyers](https://www.felixhomes.com/buy) and [sellers](https://www.felixhomes.com/sell) and help keep more profit in your pocket on each real estate transaction.\n\nNot only do we charge a lower commission on the buy side, we charge a flat [1.5% commission fee](https://www.felixhomes.com/blog/one-and-a-half-percent-commission-realtor-nashville) when we sell a home for our clients. On average, we help our clients save $12,375 when they choose to list their home with Felix. Our clients are able to save on commissions and use that cash for other important expenses such as a home renovation, family vacation, or downpayment on their dream home!\n\n## How Do We Charge Lower Commission Fees?\n\nThis is such a common question, and we love answering it! The fact of the matter is, we believe technology changed the real estate industry, but traditional Realtors are holding onto a higher commission fee for obvious reasons. Many years ago, paying a 6% commission fee may have been appropriate, but in today's world with all the real estate apps, online photos, home search websites, and virtual tours, that fee is no longer needed.\n\nIn addition, the average home price has skyrocketed. Commissions on a $700,000 are a lot more than what they would be on a $100,000 home. The 6% commission rate has stayed relatively unchanged, but all the variables that make up the rate (effort and price) have changed!\n\n## Our Final Thoughts On Buyer Rebates\n\nIn wrapping up our discussion on buyer agent commission rebates, it's clear that the landscape of real estate transactions is evolving, with technology at the forefront of this change. Felix Homes stands committed to adapting to these changes, offering buyer rebates as a testament to our belief in fair and transparent pricing. \n\nWe understand the significance of purchasing a home and strive to make this process as beneficial as possible for our clients.

(*See chart below*).\n\n![July - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_2_9137f427a5.png)\n\nThis chart can be viewed as a \"snapshot\" of each month, but what if we look at the bigger picture and analyze the number of new listings added since January? \n\nCurrently, we're on pace to match the number of new listings that were added to the market in 2022. Assuming this pace will keep up through December, it will put us at a total of just under 14,400 listings added for the year. (*See chart below*).\n\n![July - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_3_3cc694593d.png)\n\nTotal inventory starts to account for the demand side of the equation since it includes closed listings as well as stale listings that carry over each month.\n\nThis is where things start to look ugly!\n\nWe've already determined that the number of new listings added to the market each month is on pace to match 2022. But, listings are not being taken off the market at the same pace, causing total inventory to climb. \n\nAt the end of July, there were **just under 3,500 listings on the market compared to around 3,000** by this time in 2022. (*See chart below*).\n\n![July - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_4_38b747301e.png)\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nThe issue in the equation is a lack of demand. This is further supported by the collapse in the number of closings in 2024. \n\nJuly 2024 saw just 649 homes close in Davidson County – a **staggering 24% fewer** closings than in July 2022 and just under 14% fewer closings than in 2023.\n\n![July - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_5_4470bac531.png)\n\nThe aggregate picture isn't looking too much better. Keep in mind that **supply is at a 2022 level but demand is nowhere close**. I estimate we'll end the year with under 8,000 closings in 2024 compared to nearly 10,000 closings in 2022.\n\n![July - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_6_966929612b.png)\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nSo, we've got a case of increasing supply and decreasing demand. In last month's market update, we spoke at length about the \"months of supply\" – a metric used in real estate to measure the balance between supply and demand.\n\nThis metric, while seasonal, was keeping pace with the 2023 numbers. For example, in May 2023, the months of supply was 2.59 – only a smidge lower than May 2024 at 3.10.\n\nBut, **in June 2024, months of supply spiked**. June has historically welcomed a low \"months of supply,\"  so seeing such a large increase was a shock!\n\n![July - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_7_c7fa03468b.png)\n\nIf we thought June was ugly, then we weren't prepared for what we were going to see in **July – months of supply hit 4.61** (*See chart above*)! \n\nThe only times it's been higher in the past 5 years were January 2023 (4.95), November 2023 (4.67), and January 2024 (4.84)...but that's not surprising in the winter – we're in July!!!\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nHome prices continue to increase. The **median sales price came in at $530,000** in July 2024 compared to $499,900 in July 2023.\n\nSellers, don't celebrate just yet...the median sales price only accounts for CLOSED transactions. It does not include the stale listings that have been rotting away on the market for months on end. \n\nAlso, the median sales price figures do not account for \"seller credits\" (i.e. the seller contributing money towards the buyer's closing costs). It's not uncommon in this market for the seller to contribute 1% - 3% of the home price to incentivize buyers to make an offer.\n\n![July - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_8_a68933f8f9.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nThe saving grace is that mortgage rates have finally started to show some relief. We ended July with an **average 30-year fixed rate of 6.848%** and spoiler alert – they've come down even further since then, 6.62% as of August 2nd!\n\nWill lower rates bring buyers back to the market?!\n\n![July - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_9_3708f91842.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In: \n\nHomes have remained just as unaffordable as they were in July 2023. Is this the new normal? Are high monthly payments something buyers just need to get used to?\n\nIf not, one of two things needs to happen – **either prices come down or interest rates come down**. It's that simple.\n\nLet's say you're a household earning $120,000 per year. A good rule of thumb is that your housing expenses (principal, interest, property taxes, and insurance) shouldn't exceed 28% of your pre-tax income. This translates to around $2,800 per month on housing. \n\nThe median price of a home in Davidson County was $530,000 in July. Let's say you put down 10% and finance $477,000. You would **need an interest rate of 5.25%** to comfortably afford the house.\n\n![July - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/July_10_b273bcb0a9.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

The number of new listings in Davidson County added to Realtracs in October was 1,103. This was in line with the number of listings added in 2022 and 2023 – not much of a surprise there (*See chart below*).\n\n![October - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_2_cf88b2a0fa.png)\n\nFor those of you who read my market updates religiously, first off – thank you!! I've never considered myself to be the best writer but I hope I'm able to distill the information in a way that is easy to understand.\n\nFolks that have been following along this year already know that the supply-side of the market has looked fairly normal. The number of listings added since the beginning of the year is on pace to match 2022's number – just over 14,000 (*See chart below*). \n\n![October - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_3_356f5b7a0b.png)\n\nLooking at the total inventory, we start to get a glimpse at the demand-side of the market. This is where things start to look a little different compared to 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn October, the number of homes on the market hit 3,539 – the highest number we've had all year, slightly beating out the previous month (*See chart below*).\n \n![October - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_4_1396ffb5c5.png)\n\nIn short, yes, inventory is growing, however, it is not at a pace that should sound any alarms.\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nMore homes went under contract in October 2024 than in years past (*See chart below*). This was likely a result of buyers who came back to the market when interest rates dropped for all of about two weeks.\n\n![October - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_5_a796f89772.png)\n\nThe demand side of the market actually looked decent during the month of October. Since June 2024, the number of closings each month has trailed the 2023 numbers. October was the first month where there was a slight increase in the number of closings compared to the year prior (*See chart below*).\n\n![October - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_6_8cb961d3e9.png)\n\nIn aggregate, we're still trailing both 2022 and 2023. It's not rocket science, demand has slowed down in response to high mortgage rates.\n\n![October - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_7_7d3a9b5725.png)\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nWhen my clients ask me whether it's a 'buyer's market' or 'seller's market' I always like to say that it's not as black or white as that. I like to think of it as a gradient. \n\nCurrently, I'd definitely say we're trending toward a stronger buyer's market, especially if mortgage rates continue to stay elevated.\n\n![October - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_8_9840ba04f8.png)\n\nA good way to answer the age-old 'buyer's market' vs 'seller's market' question quantitatively is to look at the months of supply.\n\nMonths of supply tells us how much inventory is out there given the current pace of demand. \n\n**High Months of Supply = Strong Buyer's Market**\n\nI've stressed this key stat in my market updates ever since it spiked in June – a month when months of supply is typically pretty low. \n\nIt's no surprise that months of supply increased in October and will likely continue to increase through the remainder of the year due to the seasonality of the real estate market (*See chart below*).\n\n![October - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_9_10123a101b.png)\n\nAverage days on market stayed steady at 27 days (*See chart below*). This number isn't always the most accurate as agents routinely take listings off the market to \"refresh\" them thus resetting the days on market.\n\nThat said, I'm a true believer that homes should sell within 45 days no matter the market conditions. If it takes longer than 45 days to get an offer, it's time to reevaluate the list price or marketing approach.\n\n![October - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_10_b7ef6a79ab.png)\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nDespite the lackluster demand, home prices remain resilient. The median sales price in Davison County was $495,000 in October, up 1% from a year before.\n\nThe average home price on the other hand had its second month of large declines – down nearly 8% compared to October 2023 (*See chart below*). \n\n![October - 11.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_11_6c05681091.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates oh mortgage rates! \n\nJust as things were looking up, we're right back to 7% interest rates again. We all know that the Fed agreed to a 0.50% rate cut in September. My last market update did a good job explaining why mortgage rates didn't drop despite the fed cut.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed rate mortgage as of November 4th was 7.05%. While it's lower than this time last year, we're still a long way from what I consider the Goldilocks Zone (under 6%). \n\n![October - 12.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_12_a03efefd58.png)\n\nInflation is here to stay – possibly long-term. If that's the case, I wouldn't expect much lower mortgage rates anytime soon.\n\n![October - 13.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_13_9ee626ca60.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In:\n\nEven though rates are higher and prices rose slightly, October was still a win in my book for home affordability. The average monthly payment came in just under $2,500 per month assuming a 20% down payment.\n\n![October - 14.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_14_86b861b858.png)\n\nEven better – October 2024 had the lowest October interest rates in two years...now that's scary!\n\n![October - 15.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/October_15_f7b45d462e.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!

Achieving sub-5% rates in 2025 could dramatically reshape the market landscape.**\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"blog-banner\"/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## November In-Depth Analysis\n\n### 2025 Housing Market Predictions: \n\nBefore we jump into the Nashville housing market, many of the top real estate authorities just came out with their predictions on how the national housing market will perform in 2025. \n\nTake a look below and let me know what you think! \n\n![November - 2.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_2_7a9c2d22d4.png)\n\n### Supply-Side: \n\nLet's look at the supply-side of the market and start with the number of new listings added in November. Based on the data from Realtracs, 904 new listings were added in November 2024 compared to 1,013 in November 2023 (*See chart below*).\n\n![November - 3.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_3_62c220b013.png)\n\nJust as I predicted a few months back, we'll likely end the year with about 14,500 new listings added to the market since January – on par with 2022 (*See chart below*). \n\n![November - 4.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_4_edad7b3043.png)\n\nTotal inventory remains elevated compared to 2022 and 2023 levels, however, the gap is starting to close slightly.  (See chart below).\n \n![November - 5.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_5_41bc02de14.png)\n\n### Demand-Side: \n\nShifting to the demand-side, the number of homes that were under contract in November surprised to the upside! Compared to a year prior, the number of under-contract listings is up nearly 30% (*See chart below*)! \n\nThis is likely a byproduct of the slightly lower interest rates we experienced in the run-up to the September Fed rate cut.\n\n![November - 6.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_6_913f3b90c4.png)\n\nInterestingly, the number of closings in November 2024 remained consistent with previous years (*See chart below*). \n\nI predict the number of closings in December to outpace 2023 and 2024 as the homes that are currently under contract begin to close.\n\n![November - 7.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_7_85f3040da1.png)\n\nEven if we experience a strong December, it's likely that the aggregate number of closings since the beginning of the year will underperform 2023. \n\n![November - 8.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_8_cb200f467a.png)\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"related-posts\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Supply vs Demand: \n\nThe Felix Market Meter remains unchanged compared to a month ago. Overall, the market throughout middle Tennessee seems to be healthy. \n\nThings could change in 2025 based on the economic and political agenda. The main thing to be keeping an eye on is inflation since it plays a crucial role in determining interest rates.\n\n![November - 9.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_9_f890f1cd79.png)\n\nThe months of supply has increased with the seasonal trend as expected (*See chart below*). \n\nHistorically, months of supply is the highest in November so it will be interesting to see if it decreases when the December data is released. \n\n![November - 10.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_10_5bf9ad6a5e.png)\n\nSimilar to the months of supply, the average days on market also increased with seasonal trends as homes stay on the market a bit longer (*See chart below*).\n\n![November - 11.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_11_acd48383d8.png)\n\n### Home Prices: \n\nDespite the increase in the months of supply, both the average and median sales prices were up in November (*See chart below*). \n\nThe median sales price increased to $522,500 – up over 5.5% compared to November 2023. \n\n![November - 12.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_12_f19d9792e3.png)\n\n### Mortgage Rates: \n\nMortgage rates continued to increase throughout the month of November as well. As of 12/3, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.91%.\n\nAll I can say is this Thanksgiving, I was thankful that rates dipped back below 7%. \n\n![November - 13.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_13_5a9f375f8d.png)\n\nThat said, we're still a long way off from the sub-5% \"Goldilocks zone\". But, if we can achieve this in 2025, I think many of the \"expert forecasts\" above may need to make a revision. \n\n![November - 14.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_14_d51ec021c2.png)\n\n### Affordability Check-In:\n\nNot much has changed on the affordability front. The average 30-year mortgage interest rate is the same as it was in 2022, however, the median sales price in Davidson County is up over 8% since then. \n\n![November - 15.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_15_6d2470a740.png)\n\nKeeping the loan amount constant, you can see that we're looking slightly better than 2023 but rates or prices have to come down to make housing truly affordable for the majority of Americans.\n\n![November - 16.png](https://felix-homes-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/November_16_e970d047c7.png)\n\n## About Felix Homes\n\n Felix Homes is where five-star service meets low commissions!
